As Gary Marsh was involved in the decision with Chris Charlesworth, who have both left Loadpoint and Aerotech. The “S7586A” motor was selected to drive our spindle. Although, I have a few queries on the suitability. We required a motor that had: high torque above 5Nm could run up to 6,000 rpm. As from what I am seeing on the data sheet for the motors. The maximum rated speed is 3,000 rpm, but Gary said Chris assured him that the motor would run to 6,000 rpm due to the fine balancing of the shaft that we can achieve at Loadpoint (I cant see an email that confirms this). !image002.png\ thumbnail! The torque charts indicate that the S7586A drop off at 4,000 rpm but the B version runs up to 6,000 rpm? !image003.png\ thumbnail! Chris did some calculations via the Motor Sizer that initially looked ok. But know we understand that motor has a cut off resistance at 1000 Ohms (100ºC). So, the data will be irrelevant on the number of wafers per hour achieved, because the temperature is too high. !image006.png\ thumbnail! !image007.png\ thumbnail! Can you assure me that we have been offered and ordered the correct motor, as it will. Run at 6,000 rpm Have a torque range up to 6000 rpm and Run within temperature at this speed. Sorry to have all these questions, its just that the data doesn’t look correct for what we are trying to achieve.

Summary: Hall Sensor Fault on gimbal
Description: Hello, We recently ran into an issue with one of our gimbal stages reporting a “Hall Sensor Fault”. Our process uses the gimbal stage mounted to a robotic arm that can move it around a work piece. The fault only occurs when the gimbal stage is “inverted”, or upside down from normal operating conditions. I can hear a soft grinding sound when I spin the stage counterclockwise to the base by hand, but I feel no resistance in the stage when rotating it manually. Let me know what other information you might need from our end to help diagnose/fix this issue. I’ve included the serial number and product number found on the stage for reference. I would include pictures, but the robot is in a secure area where photos are prohibited. PN: AMG100LPES166303 SN: 24761401 Thanks in advance!

The drive price has come down as we have implemented better, more efficient processes on the Automation 1 systems. I anticipate the pricing will remain the same until at least June 30th. After that point the production costs get reevaluated. I do not have any definitive estimates of the increase July 1 but I do not think the increase will be significant. from 0% to 2% is what I would expect. There are no global chip shortages, and the mfg process is maturing. Please use the previous quote for the A3200 elements in your order. The semiconductor industry is a roller coaster—one day, there are massive investment announcements in the hundreds of millions, and the next, a new AI breakthrough like DeepSeek's reasoning model shakes the market. Despite the volatility, I’m confident demand will continue to grow, with Advantest remaining a key player in the ecosystem.

We have two problems right now: # We wanted to adjust the axles using EasyTune, but we can't change the travelDistance. The arrow keys do not work and entered values are automatically set to 0. So we can't start Easytune. what could be the reason? # When measuring, we notice that the axis starts to oscillate during acceleration and braking, which is visible on the measurements in the form of waves. On other systems we were able to reduce the jerk, which parameter do we have to adjust on the A3200 to reduce the vibration behavior? Many thanks for your help\\!

Summary: Stage controller screen error
Description: We are experiencing an issue with our 3D stage system comprising the ANT130XY and ANT95LZ stages when executing concentric circle motions. We are utilizing the following commands in our code: EnsembleMotionCWRadius(handle, axisIndexy, ydiamntranslation, axisIndexz, ztottrans, radius, speedc); EnsembleMotionWaitForMotionDone(handle, axisMasky, WAITOPTIONMoveDone, 1, NULL); The problem arises specifically when attempting to draw concentric circles with a diameter greater than 6 mm. In such cases, the stage controller screen freezes, and the motion halts. However, the same code functions without any issues for circles with diameters smaller than 6 mm. To help diagnose and resolve this issue, here are some additional details: # Stages and Configuration: # XY Stage: ANT130XY # Z Stage: ANT95L-Z # Software and Firmware: # \\Include specific software version and firmware version if available. # Behavior: # For circles with diameters ≤6 mm: No issues observed; motion is smooth and uninterrupted. # For circles with diameters >6 mm: Controller screen freezes, and motion stops completely. # Initial Troubleshooting Steps Taken: # Verified that the parameters for radius, speed, and translations are within the operational range specified for the stages. # Checked for any hardware obstructions or interlocks that might trigger during larger motions. # Monitored the system for any error messages or logs, but none were apparent on the frozen screen. We suspect the issue could be related to: The memory or processing limits of the controller during complex or extended motion paths. Configuration settings or firmware constraints that impact larger motion commands. * Any potential synchronization issues between the axes when performing larger radius motions. We would appreciate your guidance on the following: # Is there a known limitation or setting that might cause this behavior? # Are there specific debugging steps or tools we can use to better understand the root cause? # Would firmware updates or specific parameter adjustments mitigate this issue? # Any additional recommendations to prevent the freezing issue during larger diameter circle motions? Please let us know if further information or diagnostic logs are needed. We look forward to your expert advice to help resolve this issue.

Arthur Feindted: Dear Mr. Johannes, Ascii Command Interface is only activated via the parameters and it also requires an Ethernetport (e.g. TCP/IP) to send data. You send aerobasic commands to Strings, as you have configured, you can only send 1 command per line. TCP/IP can also be implemented on the controller via an aerobasic program, this must be constantly active and stored on the controller. Get -saving and set -parm over ASCII are something special. By default, with a gutparm and set -parm via ASCII, it is only possible to value or call up a parameter via the parameter numbers. In the bibothek "Installation Directory/Samples/CPP/ASCII/Operator Interface/Win/Parameter." you can read the numbering of the parameters. Otherwise you have to load the parameters names into the controller first. Please try out a gutparm or set -parm with the parameter number. Getparm 2 'Instead of a Getparm CountsPerunit for you, the "Ascii Command Interface" page in the Soloisthelp is very important. Please read the page carefully.

The source is that the workpiece that passes from the laser cutting machine that uses the movement from the Aerotech drive, it has some wave marks. So use the Digital Scope program to see the error of the axis. After that, the Easy Tune has made a less error of the Y core from before having a problem (referenced the setting normalp0.18in.sdistance0.6erroor-0.0004.0004.PPLTA), but when it continues to use the device. And try to check the error again Found that the error value has increased from the first part of the Easy Tune, which is consistent with the quality inspection department that has reported that the wave of the workpiece has increased Therefore will consult with the experts that there are guidelines to help solve this problem The picture below is the current condition that is used.

We are using an Aerotech 3D mapper system for calibrating angular position sensors. So far, we've used a stepbystep method where the rotary axis moves to a set position, and we capture the rotary axis position through communication. Now, we need to calibrate while rotating the axis continuously. In this case, relying on communication alone may cause synchronization issues. We want to synchronize the rotary axis feedback with the sensor (DUT) output. One idea is to sync the sensor output with encoder pulses. Is it possible to get the encoder signals from the rotary axis, or could you suggest any other solutions for this? Thanks for your help, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Description: Dear Aerotech, I hope this email finds you well. I am currently working with the Aerotech ES193471 dual Cartesian robot and would like to gain a better understanding of its transfer function and control system dynamics. I would greatly appreciate your assistance in clarifying the following questions: # Does Aerotech provide the transfer function model for the ES193471 robot? # What are the dynamic parameters of the robot (e.g., mass, damping, stiffness)? # How does the drive system (motors, controllers) affect its transfer function? # What control methods (e.g., PID, feedforward) are supported, and how are they related to the transfer function? # What are the limits and bandwidths of the transfer function (e.g., frequency response, resonant frequencies)? # How does an external load or payload impact the robot’s transfer function? # What type of feedback sensors does the robot use, and how do they impact the transfer function? # Are there any guidelines for tuning the control system based on the transfer function? Additionally, I have attached a Servo Loop Block Diagram to this email. Could you please confirm if this diagram is used for the Aerotech ES19347-1? If not, could you provide the correct servo block diagram for this model? If there are any technical documents, application notes, or simulation tools related to these topics, I would appreciate it if you could share them with me. Thank you in advance for your time and support. I look forward to your response. Sincerely, Jongruk R.

Summary: Additional information on ADRT-200 motor issue
Description: Hi Barb Jacqueline requested that I respond to your request for more information, unfortunately I was not on the original correspondence so don’t know what was said prior but I will attempt to clarify. Motor in question is an ADRT200170P1VPPBRK MINSI was tuning their new ELEIPC controller for our system and a motor phasing error kept occurring. When running the CME (Copley Controls) software it was noticed that the Hall sensor started lagging the phase and the lag would build until the phase error threshold was exceeded. The representative from MI-NSI believes the source of the issue is the motor. In the plot one could see the relationship of the Hall to the Phase changing as the error was building. !image001.png\ thumbnail! I should also point out that when the motor was running a slight oscillation was heard and when the drive current was plotted it also reflected this “sinusoidal” oscillation (oscillation in this case does not mean back and forth but that something might be dragging/binding slightly), not much but it was there and some of the movements would get a bit jerky when we first started the testing which both point to a possible bearing issue. Which might be separate from the phase issue and I should also point out the motor is 20 years old and since it is sealed no maintenance can be done and the manual also reflects this. We did save off screen captures and are in the process of getting them cleared through security which is necessary since we are a defense contractor. Danny feel free to add anything. Thank you Randall Dwornik

The drive price has come down as we have implemented better, more efficient processes on the Automation 1 systems. I anticipate the pricing will remain the same until at least June 30th. After that point the production costs get reevaluated. I do not have any definitive estimates of the increase July 1 but I do not think the increase will be significant. from 0% to 2% is what I would expect. There are no global chip shortages, and the mfg process is maturing. Please use the previous quote for the A3200 elements in your order. The semiconductor industry is a roller coaster—one day, there are massive investment announcements in the hundreds of millions, and the next, a new AI breakthrough like DeepSeek's reasoning model shakes the market. Despite the volatility, I’m confident demand will continue to grow, with Advantest remaining a key player in the ecosystem.

But as I read the install instructions for this, it looks like I need to first install the Automation1 – iSMCSetup.exe to configure and control the XR3 and load the HyperWire driver. Is this correct?

The large hex bolts holding the EL mirror cell were rusted. It also looked like there may be some rust on the exposed bearings next to it. Could not tell if it came off the bolts or not. These have been sitting inside a class 10000 clean room , or just in office space air. I do not think we can change the bolts without needing to recalibrate the axis. Therefore I’d expect the gimbals would need to come back. Please let me know what you think we can do for a solution at L3H vs having them ship the gimbals back. Obviously we should change the design hardware to something that will not rust across the board. I also think we are about to ship a Ball Aerospace AOMHG that could experience the same issue. I saw it in checkout last week. We may have shipped 2 others of different sizes. NGC 24” vacuum unit and 16” air unit. If I remember these were 631283, 631711, 631712 sales orders.

I've installed the software but it is prompting me for a license key. Is there any way around this? I don't have a lot of experience with the Automation1 software so a trial license would be helpful to be introduced to the system. If there isn't, I'd like to better understand the steps required for swapping drives in as much detail as you can provide. We currently have a system down in the field so this is quite urgent.

Summary: ANT130XY Hall Sensor Error
Description: Hello, My name is Andrew Gates and I work as an Application Software Engineer for AeroSpec in Chandler Arizona. We have a customer who has an Aerotech setup using this stage (ANT130160XY4DU25DUXYZ CMSNONE) along with an A3200 motion controller (A3200IAMACHINE6 AXESPROFESSIONALETCNCONNECT450066 MAINTENANCE 1.00CONFIGURED 4.09EN-USB). They emailed me recently because when they attempt to home the Y stage they’re getting an error during homing “Hall Sensor Fault”. They said this only happens when the Y stage moves towards the back of the system during homing, and despite this fault there are no issues moving the Y stage around and the encoders look fine everywhere along the travel. I don’t have too much experience with A3200 to be able to point them in the right direction remotely, so I was hoping you’d be able to give us any advice for how they can troubleshoot this further. Is there any way to monitor the hall sensors? Is there any way to change the homing routine in the opposite direction maybe address this? Is there anything we can do to try and fix this? I’ll attach their .prma file as well if it helps at all. This is on axis 1 or the Y axis. Any advice you have would be appreciated. Thank you.

Summary: Need help troubleshooting rotary axis enabling (SO # 639469)
Description: Good morning, We are in the middle of setting up a new tool, which includes a rotary axis that we are using as part of a metrology technique. The axis uses a continuous rotation 24V DC servo motor with hall sensors, and a 40,000 count, incremental A/B encoder. Feedback is working, and we have verified hall and index sensors too. However, when we attempt to enable the axis, that operation appears to hang. When we click the enable button on the Axis in Automation1 Studio, the axis turns green, but it appears to be stuck in the “enabling” state, and then we are unable to perform any actions with that axis (e.g. trying to uncheck the enable button) without resetting the controller. Using the Visualize mode, we did verify that the axis is entering the Enabling state, and getting stuck there. Attempting to execute Motor Phasing fails with a message about not being able to find all of the hall sensor states, and then disables the axis. I can’t find any location where error messages are logged. Can you provide help in how we can begin to troubleshoot this issue?

Summary: Aerotech Motor Controller Parameters
Description: Hello, I am in possession of two different Aerotech controllers. One older model (Standard Ndrive) and one newer model (A3200 Npaq) see attached photos. The older Ndrive controllers have broke, but both were used to run the same motors BM500, BM200, and ACT310. I want to use the A3200 to run the other trio of motors. For running the same motors with a different controller will I need to adjust the Gain parameters in the A3200 configuration manager to match that of the other controller? And would it be as simple as just copying the parameters from the Ndrive to the A3200 Npaq? See last two images for parameters from Ndrive and Npaq, respectively. If not how would I go about finding these values. Thank You Austen Thomas

Summary: Noisy Axis, Unexpected Frequency Response Curve
Description: The X axis has a noticeable hum while operating at high feedrates, while the Y axis is silent performing at the same feedrate. I attended the Automation1 training with Cami earlier this month, and tried tuning both axes using the frequency response graph. The phase portion of my graphs look different than the training. In the training, it always started above 180 degrees, then eventually crossed 180 at a high frequency. For both X&Y, the phase starts below 180, crosses above 180 at a low frequency, then eventually crosses back down. When I monitored the position error during motion, X & Y had very low and practically equivalent errors. Is noise on the X axis expected, or is it indicating there is an underlying problem? Frequency response graphs are attached.

Summary: Locking PSO Window Counter to Encoder Position - SO#638231
Description: Good morning, We are using a combination of PSO Distance Events masked by PSO Windows to help generate a series of trigger pulses at specific encoder positions. In the past I had had some questions about synchronizing PSO Window counters with the absolute position information, such that we could command PSO Window ranges in absolute encoder coordinates, and it was suggested that we use code like that below, to first read the current encoder position, and then push that value down (after converting to counts) to the relevant PSO Window counter. // Retrieve the Position Feedback on axis X. var $positionFeedback as real $positionFeedback = StatusGetAxisItem(X, AxisStatusItem.PositionFeedback) //Set the first window counter on X to that value after converting it to counts PsoWindowCounterSetValue(X, 1, Round(UnitsToCounts(X, $positionFeedback))) In general this works, but it does not guarantee that the values will be the same. Because these actions are separate commands and are separated in time, any movement that happens in the axis between these commands can lead to an error between the two counters. We have an application where we want to ensure that these counters are always exactly the same. Is there a way to ensure this? I do see that there is a function that allows us to configure a method to reset the counter based on Marker location function PsoWindowConfigureCounterReset($axis as axis, $optionsMask as integer) I am assuming that “Marker” in this context is the same marker that we use for homing. Is there a way to use this as part of homing to ensure that these counters are set to the same value? Also, is there a way to read back position information and PSO Window Counter values at the same time to allow us to validate that these counters are set to the same values? I think that I can see using DataCollection to do this but was wondering if there is a more direct way to concurrently read these values from the drive.

Description: We have recently purchased the XR3 and GL4, and we are trying to figure all the connections. Most of the connections are straight forward, but I am a bit stumbled on the GL4 connections. I have a couple of questions: # From the documentation we received, i.e. “638148 620D14261001 Automation1GL4-20 Interconnect.pdf”, it shows the galvo cables, control supply, and motor supply, and hyperwire connections. However, we do have a C26263 cable that says “From: XR3 HOUT Channel X TO: GL4” as shown in the picture “C26263_1” attached. I can’t find “HOUT” from the XR3, so I am assuming that this cable is to be connected from the XR3 “HSOUT”, but I am not sure which of the 5 identical but separate connectors on the other end should be connected to. I am assuming that some of them should be connected to the “ENCODER INPUT” on the GL4, but which of the 5 connectors should I use? I also noticed that the older Aerotech CLS has ground for the encoder connections as shown in the picture “Aerotech CLS Galvo 3”, but the new connectors for GL4 seems to lack the ground. I am guessing it is just the new design. # We have the old Aerotech Transformer Module running out current Galvo as shown in picture “Aerotech Transformer Module Galvo”. Can I use this to power the Control Supply and Motor Supply of the GL4? I am assuming the connections are the same as the old system with Aerotech CLS. If you could provide the answers for these questions, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Stephen

Summary: PSO Speed, Encoder Configuration, and Following Error
Description: Hi Cami, As part of our throughput optimization effort I wanted to enquire about the maximum firing speed for PSO and our maximum travel speeds and precision/repeatability. It seems there is a relationship between the actuator precision and the pso firing speed we need to consider. This article and the drive specs state 12.5 MHz maximum frequency for PSO. https://www.aerotech.com/positionsynchronizedoutputpsocoordinatepartpositionwithprocesscontrol/ I read a little concerning the maximum data rates and resolution in this article but figured it would be good to ask/check my understanding https://www.aerotech.com/wpcontent/uploads/2021/07/AerotechEngineeringReference.pdf Our current MCD has the CountsPerUnit set to 100000 with primary unit of mm. I believe this configuration will limit the maximum speeds to 125 mm/s (12500000/100000) with successful PSO firing, beyond which we would start to see gaps in pitch/firing. Is that correct? With 100000 counts per mm, we are receiving feedback at 1 count per 0.00001 mm increments or 1 count per 10 nm resolution. If we reduce countsperunit by a factor of 10 to 10000 per mm, then we have feedback at 1 count per 100 nm, or 0.1 um. My question is what is the relationship between this feedback resolution and following error at this level, and how does this also relate to actuator specifications of +/- 1.5 um precision/repeatability? Would we expect to see a significant increase in following error due to the decrease in resolution since we are still an order of magnitude outside of the actuator precision/repeatability, or is this resolution of encoder critical to holding this specification? We would not want to sacrifice precision/repeatability to obtain higher speeds as we know our following errors will climb, but I’m looking to get some understanding of how we optimize, whether these variables will allow us to run faster, and whether my perception of the limits is correct.

Summary: No motor bus power and PositionFault Error - A3200
Description: Hello Aerotech Support, One of my production test stations has stopped functioning correctly. Onset / First noticed: A production tech issued a “Home All Axes” command within our production software (no changes have been made to this code) and got a motion error. I was called to investigate. Background Info: Another engineer recently (Friday, 10/4) disconnected one of our inhousedesigned hardware subsystems that has interconnects for the EStop but told me they tested the axes motion after subsystem reinstallation and all was working correctly. Besides that maintenance, I don’t know of any specific events which may have caused this. I’ve done some debug, outlined below, but wanted to get this ticket opened in case there is something that stands out to you as a root cause or a test to run. My prelim debug: Check within A3200 Motion Composer for errors/ability to home/control the axis. (There are 3 axes on this tester, only “Theta” is exhibiting the issue; the other two axes/controllers are daisychained through FireWire on the A3200 are functioning correctly.) Enable the axis (Theta). Good; no errors/faults. Manually rotate the stage with my hand. I should not be able to do this\\! When the stage is enabled, the holding power of the motor always resists my hand moving it more than a bit before it forces itself back to position. (The stage is directly driven; our UUT is directly rotated by the shaft without gearing or any other mechanicals) At this point, I began to suspect the motor drive board (input power, fuse, etc.) so I took a DMM to the power connectors on the A3200. 120VAC input and 67VDC on each of the 3 (red, black, white) phase outputs, with respect to the ground in the same connector. Seeing Voltage on the drive output confirms (in my mind) it isn’t a blown fuse so I moved on. PositionFault Error occurs. Clear the fault and try again. Same. I looked at the position feedback in Motion Composer and Status Utility. Both report reasonable values for current position when manually rotated so it doesn’t seem to be encoder/feedbackrelated. Clear the fault and “Home”. PositionFault. No movement. I’ve checked the Status Utility and nothing stands out, except for “0x00000400 Emergency Stop Input“ in the Drive section (.html export attached) is ‘' for Theta (problematic axis) and ‘ON’ for the two working axes. When I manually depress the big red EStop button on the tester, all three go to 'ON’ and expected EStop error/warning shows in Motion Composer. I moved to Digital Scope. Configuring Position and Current (command, feedback, and error) to be captured with a long enough window, I took 2 data collections. (both plots attached) Test 1: Start Collection, “Home Axis” Test 2: Start Collection, manually rotate the stage ~90° Both show effectively zero current feedback.* I think this is the problem but I’m not sure if I should be looking at HW or SW. I’m inclined to think HW because SW hasn’t changed but nothing “concerning” has happened to the HW, either. What do you think? Thanks in advance\\! Regards, Charlie

Our code has not changed and works fine on most of our machines, but we recently upgraded PCs and the newer PC is orders of magnitude faster so the startup process is happening much quicker.

I saw a specific error that noted InTime and am trying to reproduce it to get the exact stack trace for you. My question is there a trace somewhere where I can watch to see at what exact time the InTime services are up and running, followed by when the SMC service is up and ready to be connected to? If I could watch this trace/log I could verify that we are trying to connect to it too soon. Then the question is there a way for our HMI to query in order to determine that the SMC is running and ready to go? Do we just try to connect, and if it fails continue trying to connect until it is successful? Or, is there a better way?

Summary: Substantial rotational error on motor
Description: We’re seeing a substantial rotational error on our motor and it’s put us in a line down situation. Need support sooner rather than later. Stage is mounted horizontally as standard for an ACS stage. CW direction of rotation is positive, looking from base of motor towards the rotor. The stage is integrated with a Copley Controls servo controller and amplifier. The system is seeing 36k counts per rev. Stage operates a mandrel tool that is rotated to face the ground first, and a fiducial with Cognex camera centers the mandrel. Stage then rotates 180 degrees CW to face mandrel to the ceiling. When doing so, the stage rotates up to an additional 2 degrees CW. This error then stays constant, and always additive to the direction of the most recent motion (as though it was reverse backlash).

Summary: Urgent Support Required – Issue with LEMS 2 (Rotary Collector - U Axis)
Description: Dear Christian, Good morning, I hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out regarding a critical issue with LEMS 2 in OCTG3. The machine is currently down, causing significant production delays, and we urgently need your support to resolve the problem. Earlier today, we ran several tests with Sebastian to identify the root cause of the issue: # We swapped the power cable between Laser 1 and Laser 2 to check if the problem moved, but the issue remained in the same position, ruling out a faulty laser. # We replaced the power cable from the output of the rotary collector (U axis) to the laser, but this did not fix the issue. # We also replaced the cable in the cable chain from the Aerotech PC to the machine, but this had no effect either. Based on these tests, we believe the problem lies in the track inside the rotary collector (U axis). The U axis was replaced last summer in August together with you, following the issues we experienced last year. Given the urgency of the situation, we need your immediate support to find a solution as soon as possible. Could you please advise on the next steps or connect with us remotely to further investigate? Looking forward to your response.

I'm reaching out because we are experiencing issues with the LEMS 2 in OCTG3 this morning. Specifically, the LEMS is unable to complete the calibration process. During the calibration procedure, the system triggers the following alarm on LIV2: !image001.png\ thumbnail! We checked the error log from the LEMS PC and found the following detailed error description: !image002.png\ thumbnail! In response, we accessed the LEMS cabinet to clean the sensors. We also disconnected and reconnected them, followed by restarting the LEMS PC. Unfortunately, none of these actions resolved the issue. At the moment, the machine is down, and we need to fix it as soon as possible since this afternoon (Italy time), we will start working on a product that must pass through the LEMS. Therefore, we cannot afford any downtime. Would you be able to connect remotely to gather more information and assist us? I recall that we had a similar issue during calibration in the past, and you found the solution using Matlab. Please let me know if you can connect so I can coordinate with the team on-site.

The axis without breaks prompts a general position feedack fault error while the axis with breaks gives an overcurrent or position error fault. We attempted to adjust the parameters within the Configuration Manager but to the best of our knowledge, we set everything to factory state but this does not clear the errors. We would appreaciate an evaluation from an expert if we made an mistake during setup or if it is simply tuning of parameters within the Configuration Manager.

Summary: Problems with axis of rotation (U) - Easytune does not run through
Description: Hello support team, I have an old system in the laboratory with the SN: 154397. After a long time and an interim software update on a 6 version, I wanted to put a second axis of rotation (AGR50) back into operation. This originally also belonged to the system. The SN of the axis is 154397a31a. After connecting to the 5th controller (U), the axis could also be moved. However, it was the case that a target position was not hit perfectly. The axis regulated with values +/ 0.1 degrees a few seconds. After the axis parameters were copied from the functioning rotation axis (A), the behavior was a little better. However, Easytune never went through without an error message for the Uachse and there are still small deviations from the target post. Is there a suggestion that we can still change / improve? Here is a system sapshot. If further information is necessary, I can submit it promptly. Many greetings Markus Blothe

Summary: Unable to move axis / disconnexion
Description: Dear Aerotech support team, On a customer’s machine, we regularly have an issue (every 3 hours approximately since 17th January), when we move an axis (X or Y), suddenly we have the error “unable to move axis X (or Y)” in our software and then when we go in Motion composer we don’t see any error. Also when there is the error, the Z axis fall down of a few mm (and we hear the click sound of the break). The only way to solve the problem is to disconnect / reconnect the axis in our software and then we do a homing and the problem is solved until it appears again. I don’t know how to solve this problem as there is no error visible in motion composer. Also this machine is installed since approximately 6 years and we never had this kind of problem. (Except some classical issue of connexon to the axis due to Intime misconfiguration after a Microsoft update for example, but since we have a script blocking the updates we don’t have this problem since 2 years). I attached the log of Microsoft events in case it can be useful for you to find a reason linked to Microsoft or something else. Thanks Regards, Rémi

Summary: Decoding of Auxiliary RS422 AB Encoder signal
Description: We recently encountered dropped counts when decoding the auxiliary encoder output from our new Automation1 system. We initially though that boxing the iXC2 controller and following the guide to minimise noise would solve the issue but it remains. We then reverted to the previous EPAQMR system to examine the encoder decode of it’s auxiliary output (serial 61457511) . This also resulted in dropped counts for speeds greater than 25mm/s. We had another EPAQMR system (2axis) serial 625997A11 available for test. We found the encoder decoding of that EPAQ-MR to be solid with no dropped counts at 100mm/s. When we moved this system into the machine in our cleanroom, the performance continued to be solid with no dropped counts. I’ve looked at the prme files of both EPAQs, but cannot figure out why the auxiliary output from one EPAQ is better than the other. Hardware wise, the flawless EPAQ is a two axis system where the other one is 3 axis, both contain the same ML drives. We have captured plots of the Quad AB signals, they do have some unwanted edges, but not enough to compromise the position count. Do you know if any parameters influence the output of the auxiliary port, other than EmulatedQuadratureDivider and EncoderDivider? I applied the same config from the poor performing EPAQ to the better one and the counts remained solid. This suggests there might be a hardware difference, so maybe there is some difference in the IO expansion board that mounts to the ML drive? Kind Regards, Brian

Summary: Y Axis : need to redo the calibration (LAS31) - table out of tolerance (orthogonality issue)
Description: Dear Support, The orthogonality of one of our tables is out of tolerance. This could be due to a collision, but I have no proof of this. We checked the X axis with a precision granite square. Everything is correct. But the Y axis is no longer perfectly perpendicular to the X axis. I need your help to better understand the procedure. We want to perform the calibration internally because the machine cannot wait for external calibration, and we normally have the necessary tools available (granite square & dial indicator) I found an example in your documentation, using only 2 pair points. See below !image002.png\ thumbnail! In fact, the original calibration that you provided us has 121 data pair with “sampledist” of 5um The calibration file has such parameter :START 2 SAMPLEDIST=5.000000 POSUNIT=PRIMARY CORUNIT=PRIMARY/1000.000 :START EXPANDCOEFF=7.500000e006 MATERIALTEMP=20.00 :START HOMEDIRECTION=CW HOMEOFFSET=224.660000 \ !image003.png\ thumbnail! \ \ !image005.png\ thumbnail! \ \ !image006.png\ thumbnail! \ \ !image007.png\ thumbnail! \ \ !image008.png\ thumbnail! \ \ !image009.png\ thumbnail! \ \ !image010.png\ thumbnail! \ Do you have any further explanations? How many data pairs should we enter at least? 3? Left side, middle, right side? What should the first position be? (reference position = homing position) Why does your table have 121 pair positions? Attached is our calibration file that came with the XY table, as well as the table reference/specification. Thank you in advance for your support.

Summary: calling subprograms / amplifier faults
Description: Dear Clive, best wishes for 2025!! Paul told me to contact you directly with this question: I am responsible for programming our new Raytech/aerotech machine on your Automation1 platform. Previously, I worked with the A3200 environment, and I am now developing similar software within Automation1. My goal is to keep the programming as uniform and consistent as possible. Below is an example of a cutting program structure in the A3200 environment to illustrate my approach: G1 X32.803 Y55.16 FARCALL "L14.pgm" G1 X32.803 Y56.275 G1 X31.841 Y55.16 G1 X32.803 Y55.16 FARCALL "L11.pgm" FARCALL "L7.pgm" My question: What is the simplest way to call subroutines in the Automation1 environment? So far, I have learned: How to create Mfunctions using included files How to use libraries to implement start/stop functions like L14 and L7 However, I still lack a quick method to call subprograms. This machine will need to cut up to 20 different 2D shapes daily, so a fast and straightforward solution is essential. Thank you very much for your help!

I am writing to report an issue we have observed with the resistance fluctuations of the central axis to the ground during motor operation. When the motor is stationary, the resistance is nearly zero. However, when operating the motor at frequencies of 0.5, 1, and 1.5 Hz, we have noticed that the resistance begins to fluctuate randomly, with the maximum resistance increasing with frequency (please refer to the table below for details). !image001.png\ thumbnail! Could you please provide insight into the possible causes of this issue? Additionally, we would like to understand how the grounding is implemented in the motor. Your prompt response and assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated. In the ticket software you prompt us to provide the following information so I will already include that in this email. 1 thing to note, I have no access to our original purchase documentation so for the sales order number I will use our most recent one and for the serial number I will use the one of our recently repaired spare motor.

Summary: Problem tuning an Axis
Description: Hi there. I hope you guys are all doing okay. I have a question on tuning an axis on the XR3 that does not work anymore. I almost had everything set up until there was a realization that I needed to scale the axis’ encoders so that we can fire the PSO’s at very small distances. We need to fire them 15nm apart. This was done with the NPAQ using an encoder multiplier of x8000 and setting the Unit count to 2000000. This is very high compared to the defaults of x1 and 250 units. So, after setting this up and trying to avoid running the stage at 8000x speeds that can cause significant damages, I got it right. But the tuning was now completely off with strong oscillations and noise from the stage. Running Easy Tune then failed, it kept saying the encoder signal had minimal current. I am unsure what I did, but eventually I got it to work. The encoder signals are lined perfectly up on the circle in encoder tuning, so it should work. I think I committed the new values once in there, even if they were almost identical to the old ones, and then it was able to run past the first step in Easy Tune. However it will always fail after it tries motion on the different frequencies and saying its trying to go back to start. This is the error: !image001.png\ thumbnail! “The calling thread does not have access to this service”. This error makes no sense. I run Automation 1 studio as Administrator as well to make sure it has all access. I just rebooted the PC and restarted the XR3. Always the same error. Can someone please assist on this error? I am unable to tune manually, as the parameters before setting the multiplier are unstable, and the PID parameters I have from the NPAQ are completely different. As far as I know, this error came after I set the encoder multiplier up, and it worked before I did that. Best Regards, Ronny Pettersen Production Engineer ASN Norway AS

Summary: Clients problem with X axis
Description: I attached plots from digital scope. The X stage seems to be like oscillating. We tried doing easy tune/loop transmission/feedback tuning, but nothing helped. At rest, no commands just enabled and homed, the position error seems to be a bit higher than it should, but when it starts moving after every 20nm the error and current spike and it is repeated every 20nm, FT shows a peak at 500Hz, 1000Hz,1500Hz… when moving @ 10mm/s if we double the speed the frequency is halved 250,500… as it moves 20nm faster. The numbered 0,1 tests are with a sample holder on the tables as we though it might be springy or the tightening of the screws had an impact we removed it for 2,3,4 but it wasn’t the cause. We looked at if some cables are pulling/pushing during fabrication → no they weren’t. We then also tried to reseating the X cable in the controller, as we though it might be an electronics problem, but didn’t change anything and are out of options at the moment. Do you have any ideas what might be the problem? The client still wants to work on the system and would like for a solution that doesn’t involve sending the stages for repairs. They are located in Hannover Germany so maybe a technician could take a look? If repairs are needed they asked if they could get backup stages to work on the system while theirs are out for service.

Summary: Axis lag error on BM500-ES19011 motor
Description: I am reaching out because, for the past couple of weeks, we have been experiencing issues with the motor (BM500ES19011) on the Zaxis of our Cartesian machine. The axis spindle and the gearbox attached to the motor run smoothly, so we have ruled out any issues with them. However, the motor itself presents the following problems: When commanded to move counterclockwise, it seems to get stuck at any position and starts consuming 1718 A. If we manually assist the motor shaft, helping it return to its previous position, the current consumption returns to normal. (video attached) In the clockwise direction, the motor also behaves abnormally. It does not respond when commanded through the control panel, but the current consumption increases to 1718 A. When decoupled from the spindle and manually rotated using a wrench, it offers resistance. Additionally, when the wrench is released, the motor shaft returns to its original position. Best regards, Ander

Firstly position error appears, then trying to reset it and home axis results in amplifier fault. Here is configuration file. The client says, that axis can be enabled, but homing or moving it results in errors, so it cannot be operated. There was no physical hit related to the axis and stage. What occurred was that a user was attempting to write a pattern and a position fault appeared. The software was restarted, but unfortunately, it could not home due to the position fault. Additionally, when we tried to control the stage through the A3200 motion composer, both position faults and amp faults appeared alternately. What would be further steps for troubleshooting?

Summary: Axis calibration issues
Description: Hi, I attempted to further calibrate the stage, even though it was previously calibrated by Aerotech. I understand that calibration is additive, but I'm not noticing any difference after my adjustments. I'm a bit confused about how to interpret the calibration table (please see the attached documents). For instance, the value 0.360000—what location on the stage (absolute position) does this refer to? Could you please create a schematic to illustrate the compensation and its corresponding position? This is a 250 mm stage, with the new home position set at the positive limit (131.88 instead of 6.9 as in the original .cal file). The OFFSET is now zero; is this correct? The stage can move from 0 to 250 mm—is that correct? Why does the table start and end with 0.000000? I changed every value in the table to 10, except for the start and end points (which I left at 0.000000), but I didn't see any difference when using the laser interferometer (I moved the stage from 0 to 250 mm). This is the most frustrating part—if my code were wrong, why wouldn't simply modifying the correction values in the original .cal file have any effect (without any further change, just the correction values)? Could you explain why this might be happening? Also, does the number of digits in the data (e.g., 0.000000 vs. 0.000) make a difference? What does the "reference axis" mean? Could you provide some examples to clarify this? I apologize for the number of questions, but despite reading the manual, I'm still struggling to grasp these concepts. Thank you very much for your assistance\\! Best regards, Zhengjian

Summary: NPAQ A3200 - controller compatibility
Description: Dear Aerotech support team, We have at a client's site an NPAQ controller: 612490A11 with a Zaxis PRO115SL50TT1M83LI1CP1PL0TAS. At our site, we have an NPAQ controller: 23649001. We would like to replace the client's NPAQ with the one we have, and our idea is to add an MXR multiplier to the Zaxis in order to achieve the same precision they currently have. We have the following questions: Is it possible and functional to add an MXR to the NPAQ controller we have in order to make it identical to the client's setup? Could you please confirm whether this solution is valid? If we send you our controller, could you upgrade it by integrating an internal multiplier so that it becomes 100% compatible with the client? Could you please provide us with a quotation for both of the above-mentioned solutions, if they are technically feasible? If neither solution is possible, what would you recommend in order to make our controller 100% compatible so that we can replace the client’s controller? Thank you in advance for your feedback. Best regards, NB: attached the picture of the controller we have at our site. Andy

Summary: Aerotech Stages compatibility to controllers & software
Description: Hi, i’m re-using a setup from several years ago comprising of two Aerotech stages with associated controllers & accessories, see photos for Model & S/N details. I have installed the Ensemble software and use the configuration manager to connect to the controllers, see photos. But I do not know where to go from here to get the stages operational. Can you confirm that I have the correct setup required for these stages? There is also 1 ‘limits’ connector cable on the Z stage that is unconnected (see photo). I don’t see anywhere on the controllers to plug into, is this connector required? Please let me know if there are any further details / information required. Thank you in advance for your help with this.

Summary: AutoFocus Multiple Analog Inputs and Tuning - Three Force Sensors as One Analog Input
Description: Hi Support Team\\! I am using three force sensors to act as the analog inputs for the Zstage (ANT130LZS060) to make it more up and down based on the imprint force signal. The target force value is 5 N, when the force is higher than 5, make the Zstage move upward to decrease the imprint force, when the force is lower than 5, make Zstage downward to increase the imprint force. Now, I can use the AutoFocus function, but the problem is that I can only use only one force sensor as the single analog input, but I want to use three and let their average force value as the input. Can you please let me know how to combine the three force sensors as one input? For example, F1 is 5.3 N, F2 is 4.8 N and F3 is 5.1 N, their average value of 5.06 N will the actual force input. Also, I have some problems on tuning the AutoFocus function, I read through the suggestions below: For the most commonly used sensors (position and force), the AutofocusGainK, AutofocusGainKi1, and AutofocusGainKi2 parameters are the only gains needed to tune the response of the loop. To manually tune the loop, set the AutofocusGainKi1 parameter to a value greater than the servo loop bandwidth and all other AutofocusGainKi gains to zero. Then, adjust only the AutofocusGainK parameter. For low values of AutofocusGainK, the Autofocus Loop should always be stable. Can you tell me more on how to tune the system? The current tuning configuration looks response very slowly (Z-stage is moving super slow up and down). The controller I am using is iXC2e and the drive is XC2e. Thanks for your assistance\\!

On the front of the Epaq it just says “Error no axes found”, and when trying to connect via the motion composer I get the error message “No motion axis detected on aeronet interface”. To me this points to a hardware issue, but it would be good if you could confirm or deny that, additionally if you could help in trying to determine where in the system this hardware issue lies that would be really helpful. Update to this ticket call was recieved from Justin Abitt reagrding the following; Epack system that is aprox 8 years old, it shows no axis connected and they would like to establish what the fault is / options for fixing Aslo the software for the ensemble connected with the system was running on windows 7 originally, as they upgraded to windows 10 they cannot access the software at all.

In the meantime, we've had an initial discussion with Aerotech's support staff regarding the motor drivers. They mentioned that the motor drivers could only have a single set of PID parameters configured. Given the gravitational effects on our vertically moving platform, the system's dynamic model parameters vary significantly between upward and downward movements. According to Aerotech, this could potentially result in overcurrent issues, affecting the continuous completion of upward and downward cycles. We would like to confirm with you whether this issue could indeed occur, and if possible, discuss this problem during our meeting next week. Thank you for your understanding and assistance. Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Ying, Thanks for reaching out, glad to hear this build is moving forward. Yes these drives will need to be housed in the an electrical control cabinet. Aerotech recommends an IP54 (or higher) cabinet, as specified here. Mechanical Specifications \ https://help.aerotech.com/automation1/hardwaremanuals/Automation1iXC6eandXC6web/Chapter1Introduction/Mechanical-Specifications.htm Before deciding on an enclosure size you will want to finalise your electrical design eg, 3phase distribution, transformers, safety interlocks and overload relays. When I last discussed this project, the plan was to install the motor supply directly to 400VAC 3phase Mains, removing the need for a transformer. That being said you may want to provision for space in the cabinet for a suitable step up transformer, as these drives are rated for 480VAC. Perhaps we could have a call later this week to discuss this as well as any other installation questions you might have.

Please find attached the order information for your reference. Additionally, after the electricians inspected the drivers, they advised that the entire setup should be enclosed for safety. However, they mentioned that they do not provide enclosures themselves. Since we are working with six drivers and motors, could you kindly recommend a suitable type of enclosure—for example, an electrical cabinet or any alternative solution you may suggest? We appreciate your support and look forward to your advice. Best regards, Ying Gao

Summary: Need help in integrating Aerotech stages with LabVIEW for real-time control using accelerometer sensor
Description: Dear Aerotech Support Team, I am Suraj Kumar, a PhD student at IIT Bombay, India, working under the supervision of Prof. Ramesh Singh. We are using Aerotech precision ball screw and linear motorbased stages in our custom milling machine setup. Our research focuses on realtime vibration control during milling by dynamically adjusting machining parameters such as feed rate and depth of cut. We monitor process instability using accelerometers and/or a dynamometer, with data acquisition and analysis performed in LabVIEW. Once instability is detected, we aim to adjust the feed rate and depth of cut in realtime until the algorithm determines that stable cutting has been reestablished. To implement this, we require your support in integrating realtime stage control with LabVIEW while a Gcode program is actively running. Specifically, we are interested in exploring the possibility of using feed override or passing external commands to dynamically modify the Zaxis (linear motor) depth of cut. The serial number of the stage is 158676A11. Please let me know if you require any further details about the stages or our setup. We would greatly appreciate your guidance on how to achieve this integration. Looking forward to your response. Thank you.

The issue was found yesterday when operating the tool, the error in Npaq controller popped up as no firewire connections, I then found our IPC cannot ping Aerotech PC thru 192.168.40.10. After I restored the ethernet connection in between IPC and Aerotech PC by disabling then enabling the IPv4 in the network and sharing center, firewire comms issue came again. As previously we met similar firewire case before and I followed the previous experiences by: # Reseat enet cable and firewire cable # Uninstall A3200 SW and INtime SW in both PC’s, then install the A3200 back, configuring for INtime device and node; # Double checking IEEE 1394 drivers in both IPC and AT PC, both showing working; # Pass IEEE 1394 to INtime using polling and restart PC; # Follow the troubleshooting guide and redo SW reinstall, firewire card configuration. The above actions have been performed several times, and per previous experiences it could restore the connections back, but this time I couldn’t. As I don’t have a spare Firewire card or an AT PC available for a replacement, what other configurations I might missed? Can you please help?

We have a situation here where the drive takes off in the incorrect direction after issuing a jog command from the API and then trips on over current. I believe the wiring in the field of the encoder could be swapped somewhere so that a position error is generated and this gets bigger and bigger as the drive goes in the opposite direction and then trips on over current as the servo cannot make the correction. It would be really handy to test this theory if the drive had a field to command the drive to consider the analogue signals in the opposite sense. I have seen this elsewhere on a servo drive exactly to solve this sort of field wiring issue. Of course I understand we should change the field connections and we will. However, I would just use this feature to test the theory. If I command the analogue feedback signal to be opposite and the drive works then I know to go and find this swap over of the encoder feedback somewhere.

Summary: Motor Installation Advice for AGR75
Description: Hi All, Please see below question from Frank Darmann @ ANSTO. Hi Michael, We have received the first AGR75 rotation stage with integrated incremental encoder to prototype. As you may remember Aerotek did not offer this version with a stepper motor. So we said we would make an adaptor plate to our stepper motors and install. My first approach was to remove this flange plate as shown below to expose the worm drive shaft and the provided coupling so our motor shaft can fit to the coupling. I have taken off the four fasteners hoping this plate would come off however it does not. Can you please ask for advice what is the best way I can adapt a stepper motor with a shaft to the coupling presented. Cheers Frank

Summary: EUV Tech (USA) Automation1XRE Controller will not turn on
Description: Hello, my name is Oweis Mokatish. I work for EUV Tech as a Field Service Engineer. I am currently working on a customer’s tool in South Korea. The Aerotech Controller on the tool will not turn on. At the top of the Automation1 UI it showed a message saying something along the lines of "could not find SMC". When clicking the "start" button at the top left, it fails to turn on any controllers due to this same error. All LEDs for the amplifiers were off (but the green power switch for the aerotech controller rack was illuminated). I double checked for loose connections, then verified each stage controller is receiving 208vac, and also verified 208vac is received by aerotech controller's power cable. I confirmed there are no safety interlocks active. I restarted the PC, and the tool's AC and DC power multiple times. I then saved a backup MCD from automation1 software, then tried uninstalling automation1iSMC and automation1MDK. My plan was to reinstall and upload the backup MCD. However, the PC does not allow me to uninstall SMC or MDK. It gives me "error 1711: An error occurred while writing installation information to disk. Check to make sure enough disk space is available." Theres 164GB of free space on the C drive, and I'm only uninstalling 1GB worth of programs. I am not 100% sure that the serial number I provided os correct, I will revefify the serial number on Monday. Could you please help me troubleshoot this issue and tell me the root cause + steps to resolve it? If possible and necessary, could you send someone to South Korea to troubleshoot onsite? If so, could you please provide me a quote for this service as well as a timeframe of when someone can come onsite?

Summary: Periodic current spikes an linear axis ANT130L-160
Description: We have found a periodic spike pattern in the position error graph and on the current feedback of an ANT130L160. The axis performed without issues in our UK factory. However, after shipping the system to China, we’ve seen this. The periodicity is constant over distant, not over time. This means that we see these spikes always in the same location, even if we run movements at various speeds. Further we’ve tested a simulation where we have removed the calibration compensation for both the horizontal and the vertical axis (no longitudinal and no transversal position error compensation for this stage). However, the issue was not resolved. I have attached screenshots to showcase the issue. Our AeroDiagnosis shows the pattern true to position for bidirectional movements over the full range at various speeds.

Description: 您好， 附件1展示了物镜安装情况，附件2和附件3载物平台底部的排线情况。 为了确定z轴偏移量，在加工开始前，我们在加工区域的末端刻写了一段较短的光栅作为标记光栅，在加工完光栅后，将光纤翻转90°，可以观察到光栅尾部和标记光栅的刻写深度不同（图1），而图1中的光栅加工时间仅仅有18分钟，z轴就发生了67μm的偏移。 AL LAB \ !http://thirdqq.qlogo.cn/ekqqapp/AQUVoa69nd98FHNjuMva5kRJdUmwiatEhuvO7PzN8ItkZWNpkKs6OokRHBNR87B9mdk2edCB4NtqARgXreBfgIVYGlgFfm5eokzjXQvNx8gbQolNgqfzs80DX4ibTDPA/0\ width=172,height=172!\ 过河卒1374326236@qq.com\ <https://wx.mail.qq.com/home/index?t=readmailbusinesscardmidpage&nocheck=true&name=%E8%BF%87%E6%B2%B3%E5%8D%92&icon=http%3A%2F%2Fthirdqq.qlogo.cn%2Fekqqapp%2FAQUVoa69nd98FHNjuMva5kRJdUmwiatEhuvO7PzN8ItkZWNpkKs6OokRHBNR87B9mdk2edCB4NtqARgXreBfgIVYGlgFfm5eokzjXQvNx8gbQolNgqfzs80DX4ibTDPA%2F0&mail=1374326236%40qq.com&code=Qva7oTFviOAkDkq70O4c6kZKPKqfYPJ9AD97GjCpGzmJ1PK6xvajl4Q375hamTRakEc7G1PAVISpU29o6SHxg> 原始邮件 发件人："Harry Zhou (Jira)"< Support@aerotech.com >; 发件时间：2024/7/10 9:48 收件人："1374326236"< 1374326236@qq.com >; 主题：GTSE40951 回复：GTSE40805 Z axis sinking ———— Reply above this line.

Description: I am encountering an intermittent error with the motor, displaying the message: "A communication error has occurred. This application will automatically disconnect from the network." This issue sporadically occurs with both the official software and when using my custom software to call the API. It can happen several times a day, whether the motor is running or idle. After the error occurs, reconnecting the motor and resetting it restores normal functionality without any other impacts. Please see the attached screenshot for the error message. Could you please advise on the possible causes of this error and how to troubleshoot it? 我在使用电机时遇到一个间歇性的错误，提示信息为：“A communication error has occurred. This application will automatically disconnect from the network.” 这个问题在使用官方软件和自定义软件调用API时都会偶尔发生。无论电机是否运行，这个错误有时一天会发生几次。每次出现错误后，只需重新连接电机并复位即可恢复正常功能，没有其他影响。请问这个错误的可能原因是什么？应该如何排查？ 错误截图信息见附图

The processing on the left processing surface (silver white platform) is normal, but the processing on the extended platform surface on the right is abnormal; 2. Judging from the information in the previous item, this processing procedure does not matter; 3. There may be problems with the processing surface on the right side due to the impact of external cables, air pipes or other reasons; 4. Please collect the speed, position, position deviation, current and other data during processing of the right processing surface in Scope to facilitate analysis of the reasons.

Summary: Reply: GTSE-40805 Z axis sinking
Description: Dear Klaus， As for your question of not finding Zaxis sinking, we have made a clear explanation in our previous emails and remote messages: During the processing process, obvious defocus can be found in the camera field of view. At the same time, we observed that the Zaxis coordinates did not change. In order to determine this problem, we did the following experiment, fixed the SMF28 quartz fiber on the slide, then focused the objective lens on the quartz fiber, recorded the Zaxis coordinates, and then stood for 30 minutes, during which no operation was performed, half an hour later, defocus phenomenon occurred, that is, the image of the quartz fiber core edge was observed to change (fig.1). In order to rule out the possibility of defocusing caused by the movement of the fiber, we carried out the same experiment with a slide, and the obvious defocusing phenomenon also occurred. I think this experiment is enough to prove that there is a fault in the displacement system, which causes the distance between the objective lens and the platform to change. The Zaxis coordinate you mentioned in the last email did not change, I think this is part of the system failure, and can not be used as a reason to judge that there is no fault in the displacement system. The phenomenon observed by the objective lens should be more intuitive than the background data. You can try this experiment the next time you are remote. (PS: You may feel that the defocus in fig.1 is not obvious, but the defocus speed of 510μm/h has a very big negative impact on grating processing.) Another problem is that the optical fiber fixture cannot be used normally at present. When the preset trajectory of the optical fiber fixture is a straight line for processing, the writing marks will bend in the x direction (fig. 2); However, when the left platform is used for processing, this fault does not occur (the displacement platform is shown in fig.3, with the left platform in the red frame and the optical fiber fixture in the blue frame). Turning off the motor of the displacement table and pushing the load platform by hand, we found that when the platform moved to the right side, the resistance increased. This may be the cause of deviation of the write track when using the optical fiber fixture. I didn't see you checking for this problem the last time I was remote. I have reported this issue several times via email, but I have not seen any attempt to resolve it. We hope to use this system to achieve precision machining, but the fault of the displacement platform still cannot be used normally six months after we signed for it. We hope you can arrange engineers to go to the site for investigation as soon as possible Best regards， ALL \ !http://thirdqq.qlogo.cn/ekqqapp/AQUVoa69nd98FHNjuMva5kRJdUmwiatEhuvO7PzN8ItkZWNpkKs6OokRHBNR87B9mdk2edCB4NtqARgXreBfgIVYGlgFfm5eokzjXQvNx8gbQolNgqfzs80DX4ibTDPA/0\ width=94,height=94!\ 过河卒1374326236@qq.com\ <https://wx.mail.qq.com/home/index?t=readmailbusinesscardmidpage&nocheck=true&name=%E8%BF%87%E6%B2%B3%E5%8D%92&icon=http%3A%2F%2Fthirdqq.qlogo.cn%2Fekqqapp%2FAQUVoa69nd98FHNjuMva5kRJdUmwiatEhuvO7PzN8ItkZWNpkKs6OokRHBNR87B9mdk2edCB4NtqARgXreBfgIVYGlgFfm5eokzjXQvNx8gbQolNgqfzs80DX4ibTDPA%2F0&mail=1374326236%40qq.com&code=FMT6H8v6pzKuwRk35hsDOsV2UdYST5jKOFxOHWJgMzv5hgobTFrkgMRJrzglf70kRHTLzmtAvATKxdFzesnw> 原始邮件 发件人: "Support" <Support@aerotech.com>; 发送时间: 2024年7月4日(星期四) 下午3:23 收件人: "过河卒"<1374326236@qq.com>; 主题: GTSE40805 Z axis sinking ———— Reply above this line.

Summary: Ensemble QL controller failure description
Description: Hello, experts from Erodek Motion Control Technology Co., Ltd.! We are Hunan Tailihengyou Technology Development Co., Ltd. Currently, we use the motion controller of your company brand, which may be original in the United States. The relevant problems are described as follows: Ensemble QL controller (label model is ensemble ql250-c) The fault that occurs is an interval abnormal noise (sizzling sound). The abnormal noise time is about one second. During the abnormal noise, all indicator lights of the controller will go out, and then the indicator light will return. The OPWR indicator light is green and the ENB/FLT indicator light is red. We judge that under normal circumstances, there will be no short-term out. Under normal circumstances, the OPWR indicator light and ENB/FLT indicator light should be green. Therefore, according to the phenomenon, we believe that there may be a fault. If we need to provide a fault performance video or photo, we can also provide it. The help we hope is whether your company and technical experts can help with troubleshooting or repairing, or whether there are other more convenient solutions. Looking forward to a reply! Thanks for your support!

Summary: New Automation 1 drive Vrs soloist drive.
Description: Hi. Hoping someone can help clarify something. We have historically used Aerotech slides and drive in some of our machine. up until last year we had the Soloist drive connected to a liner axis. We purchased 3 new machines from a vender and the drives were replaced with the Automation 1 style of drive. both these old and new are doing the exact same process but the old drive is fractionally quicker. over a lot this adds up to 6 minutes in total. I have attached 2 scopes i have taken from the drives for comparison. Is there a reason the newer drives are slower or is this just a tuning issue? Dipper 7 is old soloist drive and dipper 9 file is automation 1 drive. I'm just trying to understand the issue first before retuning as this may lead to a revalidation of that part of the machine.

Summary: Error: Could not allocate memory for this controller operation
Description: Good morning, We have been using the Studio Software to run the same fixedlength program multiple times on the system. Although the program is quite long, the system is able to build, compile, and execute it successfully. However, after running the compileandexecute cycle approximately seven times, we encountered the following error: “Error: Could not allocate memory for this controller operation.” Once this error occurs, the only way to restore system functionality is by resetting the controller. Unfortunately, this reset also affects the 3axis controller and the reference system, requiring a complete system realignment from scratch—something that is highly disruptive to our workflow. Is there a way to handle this error more gracefully? Specifically, is there a method to free or clear the controller's memory after each program run, considering that the programs are independent of each other?

Summary: High NPAQ XYZ amplifier temperature
Description: At one of our clients systems the amplifier temperatures for XYZ are around 50/50/40 degrees when in a set position with enabled axes. I also noticed that the currents for XY were not around 0 when enabled but around 0.2(Digital Scope value) for both, so I did a loop transmission and reduced them to oscillate around 0 more, about +-0.02 and the temperature started to fall, but for now still seems pretty high. They were having some problems where Z axis kept getting temperature faults, but from short tests I noticed that it doesn’t seem to be cause by Z movement but, more due to the time it might start increasing and more likely from the near hot X and Y amplifier temperature(XY also move during fabrication so probably also increase in temperature). We checked the fans they seem to be spinning, air intake also seems to be fine. I also have a suspicion that the other compartments below and above might have an impact, so could you share a top view with marked location where the corresponding axes amplifiers are located of an NPAQ controller. I also adapted their code to use AB axes more than XY, so that might also help. The room is clean little to no dust, and is cooled to 19 degrees. So wondering if you might have some more insights why the temperatures are quite high, we haven’t had this problem before on our own or other systems.

Summary: Automation1 Encoder Signals from Aux Port - noise issue
Description: Hi, I’m integrating an iXC2e drive to replicate the function of the EPAQMR it’s replacing. The Auxiliary output port specification appears to be the same differential RS422 AB Encoder Signals as the EPAQMR. The pinout is different. To account for the different pinout, I have cut the Aerotech supplied molded db9 from the cable and installed a regular DB9 connector (rs# 7659432) and connected pins 2>2, 3>7, 4>1, & 9>6. I lifted that pinout from Table 34 of the iXC2e manual and mapped the new pins to match Table 222 from the EPAQ-MR manual. This reconfigured DB9 connects to an external module. We’re experiencing enough noise on the encoder signal that it’s causing the resolved position to drift when the stage is stationary, making it unusable for the application. Can you advise if there are any configuration options that could be influencing the signals. On the new end I have soldered the cable shield to the shell of the db9 which helped a little. I need to figure out if I need a special cable manufactured and what properties might need to be specified for this. Kind Regards, Brian

Summary: Clarification on "Units" for PositionErrorThreshold parameter for BM75 motors with a TR of 5
Description: We are using Aerotech BM75 motors in our setup. A gearbox (with TR = 5) is attached to our Aerotech BM75 motors. Following a previous communication with Aerotech, we configured the motors such that user input speed corresponds to the actual output angular speed at the load. When we turn the load at high angular speeds 3600 deg/s (at the motors this would correspond to 18000 deg/s) we encounter a position error fault. I have seen that this fault can be eliminated by changing (increasing) the PositionErrorThreshold parameter. This parameter units are defined as "User units". The parameter is defined as the difference between position command and position feedback. I have this parameter set to 360. Can you please advise if this "user units" for this parameter is the angular rotation at the motor, or the angular rotation at the load? The angular rotation at the load will be (1/5)th of the angular rotation at the motor. Thank you for your time.

Description: Dear Aerotech, I am contacting you today from Medtronic company about our backfill welder equipment to inform you that we are facing a problem : we lost the communication with the axis system last friday morning, and are troubleshooting since then. Here is the detail of what has been done already: 3 devices were processed, and then error message on the HMI: HMI not responding. → intervention of our technician, that found that the xaxis drive was in error. First thing we did is a reset of the error by plugging out and in the power of the x drive, and then restart the HMI. → Axis homing impossible, this time error message “zaxis has crashed”. z axis is not in extreme position. From there, attempt of communication with any aerotech drives via Nload application → impossible, we got the error “no powered drives on 1394 network”. We had a suspicion of corrupted files → we deployed a ghost → restart of the HMI and got an error message: Firewire card of the PC equipment. * Replacement of the Firewire card and restart → same error message as at the beginning : axis homing impossible, zaxis has crashed. Not possible to communicate with any of the 3 axis. Actual state: axis homing impossible, error message zaxis has crashed on HMI ILT machine. Not possible to communicate with any of the 3 axis.

Summary: Controller errors in printed microlenses
Description: Hello guys, We are using your systems for 3D additive and subtractive laser technologies. Currently, I am working on printing microlens, however I obtain some defects in volume of the lens, which I guess is related to controller limitation (resolution of encoder). In this particular system I am in principle only galvanoscanner (AGV-HPO + GL4). After galvanoscanner, the laser beam is steered through additional optics to microscope objective. The printing is done scanning laser beam in concentric circles. However, the issue is that I obtain a periodic pattern of lines in A and B directions, there is no dependence for scanning speed. The periodicity of lines corresponds to ~65000 unitcounts/mm, which I guess could be a resolution of encoder? 16bits? I have attached an image of a lens, where you can observe these periodic pattern of lines. The lens was printed by scanning laser beam in concentric circles. What is the resolution of the encoder, is it not 25bits? What happens at this each 65000 unit counts, does the controller make some compensation? Are any ways (tips/tricks) how to get rid of this movement errors? @bryangermann, might you have some experience with such a case? Any insights and solutions would be very welcomed. Let me know if you have any questions. Kind regards, Titas Tickunas

We think we know which drives to order but want to check the stages/motors are compatible with the new ones. I’ve attached a spreadsheet with a table in it detailing the stages, motor, current drives and the proposed new drives. Some of the motors have no stage fitted to them, as they are just used to actuate components. We are aware that the Y axis drive is not exactly equivalent but believe the new proposed drive should be fine? There upgraded system will also have two additional axes (QWP/HWP), which is why they currently have no drives fitted. Please let me know if there are any issues or whether more information is required. Also, to upgrade to Automation1 and still run on A3200 we need to upgrade the license. We have highlighted a license we can use (SN:622770A1-1), which was recently used successfully on another Automation1 drive system for some trails. We would like to transfer this over to the new PC on the system. Will this be possible? Also our internal information on this license and where it come from is spotty. Can you give us a breakdown of what this license includes and whether there are any issues with using license long term? Best regards, Paul Nicholas

Summary: Controller losing connection with PC when Motor is enabled.
Description: Motor ADRT 150135 when enabled is causing the controller to loose connection with the PC. Issue was reported when one of our engineers decided to tune this motor and discovered that attempting the tuning process ,using the Aerotech software, would cause the controller to loose connection with the PC. On the setup used at CML we are using two Aerotech controllers and two motors. Motor in question is referred to as X in the following debugging process description. # Y stage is working as expected tunes without any problems # X stage is was loosing connection with the controller while tuning. Controller was replaced with a spear unit, no change in behaviour. # All communication cables were replaced PC to controller and Controller to controller, with new units. Stage would tune when conservative setting were selected. # Reinstalled the original controller and tried tuning again stage would tune in normal setting. After several runs to confirm that it's working as expected Stage X started to fail again. # Stage Y was remove in order to change position of the X motor, theory was to spin the motor by hand in order to move the ball bearings in to different positions, clear any dirt buildup also to rehome the motor in different orientation. It is important to note that during normal operation at CML motor does not spin in full rotations. Only a small Range of motion is used. After spinning the motor several times and reattempting to tune it controller looses connection as soon as the stage is enabled.

Summary: Coordinated motion with a rotational and linear axis
Description: We use a rotational stage on top of a linear stage, for laser processing of rods and tubes. Laser processing should happen with a constant motion speed on the workpiece surface, in mm/s. If this involves both axes, this creates a problem: the rotational axis is controlled in degrees. This can be converted to length units on the surface, taking the workpiece diameter into count. E.g., processing a 10mm diameter rod, the 360 degree rotation is equivalent to the circumference pi*10mm = 31.4mm. How do I set this up? I think I can do this by changing the primary or secondary units to mm, every time the work piece diameter changes. This I would have to do manually in the machine setup, changing the CountsPerUnit or SecondaryUnitsScaleFactor, and then resetting the controller. I would rather do this from my software through the .Net API, but I think this is not possible? Or is there a better way? For lines I could do the motion without changing the controller to mm units, by calculating the coordinated speed depending on the line angle. But this would not work for curves or arcs.

In addition, phase change occurs by 180 ° between the A and the B channel of the encoder, as can be seen in the picture in the appendix. That would mean a change of direction. We want an aux encoder signal with the highest possible resolution (the internal 0.1 µm of the feedback system). If the feed rate becomes too high (> 500 mm/s), we would reduce the parameter of emuladed quadrature code code accordingly. In my opinion, several MHz should be possible here. Are there parameters to be configured to get higher frequencies from the Auxiliary Encoder Channel? Sincerely, best regards Mathias Müller

Summary: Interpretation of axis and drive statuses
Description: Dear Aerotech Support Team, I am currently testing our new Galvo Scanner system and am trying to understand how to interpret the driver and axis status bits with respect to the motion. In short, I would like to monitor the MotionDone signal from the Axis to know when a motion is finished. Looking at the attached Graph, it seems that this signal is, however, shifted with respect to the actual motion. The behavior I see in the Graph is not what I would intuitively expect or how I would have interpreted the documentation about the MotionDone status: “““ The } function waits for the commanded velocity to get to zero. You can see if an axis has a commanded velocity of zero with the } bit in the } status item. “““ It seems to me in the graph that the MotionDone Bit has returned to 1 long before the commanded velocity has returned to zero. Similarly, the acceleration and deceleration phases reported by the drive seem to be shifted with respect to the actual response of the system. And why does the InPos bit not change to 0 as soon as the move to a new target position is commanded? I would appreciate a short feedback on this, I am probably simply confused. Many thanks, Christian Schlepuetz

November 2024 14:02 An: Pascal Bronner <pascal.bronner@AUTEWE.de> Betreff:* Re: Schnittstelle Aerotech Antriebsregler iXR3/XR3 Hallo Herr Bronner, grundsätzlich sind die analogen und digitalen I/Os zu programmieren. Ohne Programmierung gibt es nur wenige via Firmware bereitgestellte Grundfunktionen. Z.B. kann ein Eingang als ESTOP (EmergencyStopFault) Eingang voreingestellt werden. In der Fehlermaske kann dann die Reaktion der betroffenen Achse oder des Gesamtsystems definiert werden. Der ESTOP Eingang ist aber eine SoftwareFunktion, während der STO eine sicher in der Hardware umgesetzte Funktion ist. Das Verhalten ist ähnlich, aber ESTOP kann programmiert werden, ein/ausgeschaltet, usw. STO ist eine HardwareFunktion und reagiert immer gleich auf einen Spannungsabfall am dedizierten zweikanaligen STOEingang: 1) Es wird ein ESTOP ausgelöst, wie erwähnt erfolgt die Reaktion der Achse wie in der Fehlermaske voreingestellt, z.B. ein kontrollierter Stop. 2) Nach ca. 450550ms Verzögerung wird die Leistungsversorgung des Motors sicher unterbrochen (Safe Torque Off) Ist der ESTOP für einen kontrollierten Stop konfiguriert, dann ist für den STOFall keine weitere Maßnahme erforderlich, um die Achsen zu bremsen, solange ca. 500ms Zeit ausreichen. ( https://help.aerotech.com/automation1/hardwaremanuals/Automation1iXR3andXR3web/Chapter2InstallationandConfiguration/SafeTorqueOffInputSTO.htm ) "A typical configuration requiring a controlled stop has the Emergency Stop Fault mask bit set in the FaultMask, FaultMaskDecel, and FaultMaskDisable parameters. This stops the axis using the rate specified by the AbortDecelRate parameter. The software will disable the axis as soon as the deceleration ramp is complete. This is typically configured to occur before the STO channel turns off the power amplifier transistors." Neben den paar über die Firmware voreinstellbaren Grundfunktionen zur Handhabung von I/S, muss und kann die Handhabung mittels Programmierung (in Aerotech Programmiersprache) individuell gestaltet werden.

Summary: X Axis Posi Error during Z Movement
Description: Dear support team, on one of our systems, we put the z -axis up with a laser distance sensor during the process so that we do not run out of focus. To do this, we wrote a program that creates a height profile and saved as CSV (line 96136). This CSV is taken into account in a further part of the same program in order to then read in Z during processing (line 185204). In the processing step we work with the Velocity on command. Our problem: Whenever z is re -enacted, the x axis also stops briefly and causes a position error of 0.5 to 1 µm. With a required process step width of 2 µm, this leads to no longer negligible deviations in processing. Question: How do we get the X -movement of the lines in 185204 or so dominant so that the journey (and the PSO trigger \\!) Is no longer interrupted by the catering? We tried it with the commands (including) Scurve, without improvement. Moveaabs is not possible in the 195 line (the, the creation). In the appendix: 2x screenshots from the plot. 1x the main program 1x the height map as CSV (and a description as TXT) 1x a plot. Thank you in advance \\! Sincerely, Sebastian Ofen

Summary: Request for implementation of a additional virtual axis in Automation 1
Description: Dear Mam or Sir, In our laser setup involving 4 physical axes (3 linear, 1 rotational), we want to implement a fifth virtual rotation axis. This axis should be used in continuous running mode to produce a clocklike position signal, which is used as a “clock” to synchronize laser triggering with the software used to controll the system (DMC) via a TriggerDelay Generator. The according Pin Setup used is shown on the attached slide. We would need support via remote to setup this axis completely without crashing the existing setup and define its setup to befit the desired utilization. Possible appointments for next week are Monday 02.09.2024 after 15:00 or Wednesday 04.09.2024 after 14:00 best regards, Daniel Müller

Summary: PSO encoder direction
Description: Hello Mr. Jäger, I have another question about designing the PSO Codes with Automation 1 software. When configuring the axes in Studio, the “Reverse Motion” option can be activated for each axis. As long as this option is not activated, I would expect the PSO Counts to count in a positive direction when moving. If “Reverse Motion” is activated, I would expect that when moving in positive axis units, the PSO counts count in a negative direction. That is good for C and D. With the axes X and Y, however, the counting direction of the counts is precisely inverted, see attached programs and plots. Reverse motion is activated for X in our case, not activated for y. In the PSOWindowConfigurinPut () function, the counting direction of the counts could be inverted via the last argument $ reversedirection. This parameter is deliberately placed on false in both attached programs to display the actual counting direction. In order to achieve positive country direction for positive axis direction, this argument must currently be set for X and Y in contrast to the setting in the configuration. I would like to understand why this is so. Sincerely, Fabian Hilbert

Summary: PSOANALOG Syntax Difference between A3200 and Automation1 drive regulator
Description: Dear Aerotech team, we have a running code with PSOANALOG Commands on our A3200 controllers (NMark & GCL). An example .PGM of this is in the appendix. With associated scope plot. So far we have modified this code slightly regarding the differences in the PSOWindow Commands between Automation1 and A3200. However, the PSOCONTROL C Fire at Automation1 Controllers seems to lead to the laser (PsooutPut1 status) concerns, despite the fact that the Windows still open correctly. When I get the PSOCONTROL C Fire, the laser (PsooutPut1 Status) reacts correctly depending on the PSOWindows. If the PSOCONTROL C Fire is commented on, the PSOANALOG array does not seem to go through or the laser power is set based on the PSOANALOG array. I ask you to understand that the PSO -Analog or $ Task Array is filled with 751 values, which of course bloated a bit. Please focus on what before and, especially after defining the PSO -Analog or $ Task Array. Then it is actually very manageable. Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to connect the C.AO (0) to C.Aain (0) on our Automation1 system, since the back of the GL4 was unfortunately very difficult to move. For this reason, C.Aain (0) only shows noise on the AT1 plot. In the scope, however, as already described above, I see that the PSOOutput1 does not switch correctly when the PSOCONTROL C Fire is in the code. This seems to me to be the main problem. I would be grateful if you can tell me to what extent I have to adjust the Automation1 code to achieve the same behavior on the PsooutPut1 status and the laser power is set using the PSOANALOG Array. I am available to you at any time. Also gladly by phone at 49 931 908792-38. Kind regards Jörg Lechner 49 931 908792 38

Summary: Inquiry About E-Stop and Interlock Requirements for ABL1500 Stage with Soloist ML Controller
Description: Dear Aerotech Support Team, I hope this message finds you well. We are currently using an ABL1500 linear airbearing stage with a Soloist ML controller. According to the manual, it is important to Estop the system when the air pressure drops below the recommended threshold to protect the stage. We have a pressure switch that activates when the air pressure falls below the minimum level, and we are considering connecting it to the controller’s Estop input. However, the Soloist ML manual also advises using an external interlock circuit to disconnect the motor wires during an Estop. Could you kindly clarify if the external interlock circuit necessary when the Estop is triggered solely by low air pressure, or is it primarily intended for scenarios involving human safety? Looking forward to your advice.

Description: Hello, as you know we get an engine from you, see pictures in the appendix. We have a control box with an Aerotech controller (Soloistcp10mxuextshunt) with this engine. We need some information from you for this controller, if you are not the contact person, please forward our concern to a suitable place. Is there a recommendation for braking resistance for the operation of the controller with the engine? Is there a recommendation for a network input filter? * Would you have a user manual for the controller for us? It is currently the case if we connect our control box to our power grid and operate the engine, the RCD / FI circuit breaker triggers. We suspect that when changing the rotation of the engine, a certain residual voltage is given back into the network and thus trigger the protective switch. Simply report if you have any questions.

Description: Hello Our company purchased the Aerotech platform from your company in 2006 The model number is: Xaxis ABL10150 (upper axis) Y axis ABL10150 (lower axis) Zaxis ATS150 (vertical axis) The platform equipment is currently placed in the Department of Mechanical Engineering of National Chung Hsing University for micromilling experiments. However, some abnormal problems have occurred on the platform recently, making it impossible for the experiment to proceed smoothly. Among them, the Yaxis cannot float normally after being supplied with 6kg/cm2 air pressure. The gap between the slide table and the track is too small, causing track friction and preventing it from moving normally. In addition, when the Z axis returns to the origin, it will hit the limit of the platform, causing the return to the origin to fail (occasionally).

Summary: Controller Connection Issues
Description: Getting errors when trying to start the controller in Automation1 Studio. For months there were no issues doing motion and running programs, but this morning the breaker was turned off for the XR3’s. When the breaker was turned back on, I got the following error when trying to connect: “No devices were found on the HyperWire motion bus. Make sure that all devices are powered on. Then make sure the HyperWire cables are connected.” Everything had power, and I unplugged and re-plugged all the hyperwires. I tried restarting the computer and powering off the XR3’s, and it swapped between the above error and: “An error occurred while the controller tried to communicate to the HyperWire card.” I tried walking through the HyperWire Communication section under the “About Automation1 System”, and everything seemed normal and talking to INtime. Finally after a two more restarts I got stuck in a weird purgatory where it would not throw an error, but was stuck trying to connect to the computer. I think the serial number I attached is for the motion stage, let me know if I need to find the XR3 or HyperWire serial. What troubleshooting steps should I take?

Summary: Issue with motors
Description: Voicemail message from Chris Crofton: Issue with Aerotech system, motor issue EB Industries Long Island NY 6312938565 I will try to give the most information I can. A few days ago, one of the motors on our system started having feedback issues; it appeared that the encoder had failed in a certain position. We tried a spare motor we had, but are getting a weird issue. When initially connected, we got a position fault and motor temp error. I disabled the motor temp fault mask, and was just left with position fault. The odd thing is that with the motor disabled, the count is moving as I turn the motor shaft. However, when I enable the motor, it just errors. I also verified that the Hall effect sensors were reading, which they were. I changed the motor feedback type to nonmultiplier which allowed the motor to stay enabled, but when I tried to command a move it immediately ramped up current and tripped on overcurrent. I was able to connect a different motor that worked fine so its not the drive, but the motor I need to drive this fixture I cannot get to work. We have a few spares which all exhibit the same symptoms. The system is the XR3 system we purchased in 2019. The original motor is a BMS100AD25E1000ASH; backups we have are BMS100AD25-E1000H. Is there any way to make these work on our XR3? Thank you, Chris

The position feedback in the status utility indicates that the axis is responding fine. When the axis is energized and working properly it also faults with a slight push with the hand. On another system they have, the same model axis is capable of withstanding a harder push before faulting out. Could this be an indication of a failing motor inside the axis? If so, can the motor be replace in the field or would the stage/motor have to be sent to Aerotech for repair?

Summary: Inconsistent homing on one of the motors
Description: Tech Support, Please get in touch with Bob and Darren at Raytheon. One of the BMS280AMSE2500H motors SN# 41527306 is behaving a little differently than the others. When they tell the motor to home, it goes in one direction, finds the marker, stops, and says it is home. The problem is that if they tell it to go home again, the motor sometimes spins around a full 360. The other motors are not doing that. Is something wrong with the motor? Is this typical behavior? Just a variability in bearing friction? The fundamental problem is that they retrofitting a machine with no end of travel sensors. That is an entirely different issue outside of Aerotech's control. I suggest a phone call with Darren & Bob in the interest of time. Please add me to the case as a watcher/participant. Sincerely, Jeremy Donatell Sr. Sales Engineer

Summary: How to reset the Automation1 controller
Description: Question 1 of 2: How to reset the Automation1 controller without cycling the power and without connecting via USB or Ethernet, which is not available when our controller locks up? Our iXC6e controller is locking up a few minutes after power up. This is an intermittent problem that we have not been able to reproduce systematically. It would be nice to know if there is a switch to reboot the controller without having to unplug all the equipment on the chassis. Once we are able to consistently reproduce the lockup situation, I will update this ticket. Question 2 of 2: How can I get Firmware version from A1 Controller? Is there an API to get it? Thanks Jaime

Summary: Single axis system setup
Description: Hi Jeff, I admit, this is beyond my level programming experience. I've CC'd our Global Technical Support team on this message. One of their product support engineers will be in touch to help. GTS, Jeff is trying to set up a single axis system to be geared to an encoder signal via the Auxiliary feedback input. Prior to his use of Automation1 he was able to do this in Soloist via the clock and direction functions. I believe this can be managed on the new controller via Gearing functions and FeedbackSetup Parameters. Can you assist Jeff with this implementation? His SO # is 640247.

I am trying to set up gearing the axis to the auxiliary feedback input. I can set the ratio with GearingSetRatio(X, 1.0) and I can turn gearing on with GearingOn(X, GearingFilter.Filtered). The problem is in associating the input from the auxiliary feedback input to the gearing for the X axis. The function GearingSetLeaderAxis() is the only place I can find that takes a GearingSource, but it also requires another axis as the leaderAxis. I don’t have another axis to give it as the leaderAxis. How do I get this working?

My group recently purchased a HexGen 500350 hexapod system with an Automation1 controller (order 639765A11). I am trying to get the controller booted up so we can get it integrated into our control system. When I powered up the controller and plugged it into the network here (using the ENET port on the right side of the back panel), I am not getting any link lights on the connector. Is there something I'm missing? I couldn't find anything in the manual that was helpful for this problem. Thanks. Alan

Summary: Rotary Motor Shorting Out/Poor Connection
Description: Good afternoon, This is Rujing Zha, a PhD student from Northwestern University. We purchased an Aerotech motion system a while back with a gantry, dual Y and Z stages, and a dual rotary stage. The system is used in a powderlaser metal additive manufacturing (AM) process. Recently we have been having some issues with the motor running the "A" stage. The motor occasionally fails due to a "motor temperature fault" when sliding the stage around, putting stress on the cables, which is usually fixable by acknowledging the error and reenabling the motor. However, recently we have encountered the motor having a position feedback fault which does not readily resolve itself. At this point the issue could be between the motor and the control cable or one of the cable junctions (there are two in the chamber) Is it possible to help troubleshoot this issue? !image.png\ thumbnail!

Summary: Inquiry Regarding ALS130 Series Linear Stages and Compatible Controllers
Description: Dear Aerotech Support Team, My company, InResTech, Inc., is a small business specializing in R&D and instrumentation development for scientific research. Our current project involves the development of a 3D cryogenic fluorescence imaging scanner for the University of Pennsylvania. This system utilizes a 30–50 μm fiber optic light guide to perform rapid 2D scans of biological specimens frozen in liquid nitrogen. The sample is sequentially sectioned and scanned in 2D to enable full 3D reconstruction of the fluorescence signal. Typical sample sizes range from 10 mm × 20 mm to 15 mm × 30 mm, with scan step sizes between 10 μm and 50 μm. Our existing 2D scanning platform is based on stepper motors with finepitch acme and ball screw stages. While it achieves line scans of 10–20 mm in under 0.3 seconds, the system suffers from high mechanical noise and rapid wear at high speeds. To improve performance, I am considering a redesign using ironless directdrive linear motors to achieve the following goals: Significantly higher scan speeds Smooth and stable bidirectional scan motion with consistent velocity Reduced mechanical noise and improved system longevity I would greatly appreciate your help with the following questions: Q1. Could you please provide specifications, user guides, and documentation for the Aerotech ALS130 series directdrive linear stages? I am considering purchasing from a third party one of the following models: ALS130100NCLTAS25DU ALS130150LT150X5025DUNC However, I could not locate detailed documentation for these specific models on your website. From what I understand, the ALS130H may be similar but is not identical. Q2. Which of the following Aerotech controllers are compatible with the ALS130 stage? Soloist Ensemble Automation1 Q3. If I purchase an Aerotech controller directly from you to use with the ALS130 stage, will the necessary software and stagespecific cables be included? Q4. If I obtain an Aerotech drive/controller from a third party, what are the available options for software support and integration? Thank you very much for your time and assistance. I look forward to your response. Best regards, Eugene Tsykalov InResTech, Inc. etsykalov@hotmail.com\ mailto:etsykalov@hotmail.com 6102134679

Questions: # Your “ Configuring Automation1 without hardware (Virtual Mode)” article states “The Automation1 iSMC MUST be installed for this to work”_.

Summary: Intermittent faults on Y axis
Description: The machine that I am trying to upgrade exhibits random behavior on the Y axis. We suspect either the feedback or the motor cable have gone bad. Cables are integral to the gantry. On the Y axis we occasionally see an issue where it throws a position error, or an overcurrent error. This is happening in the NView HMI software when we’re manually jogging the motors around. When we try to run the machine it quickly faults out during cycles, which we think is due to the same fault being thrown while we’re operating. The intermittent nature of the problem is what made us think it could be one of the cables. Possibly there are some positions of the cable track that happen to line up with a worn part of the cable and cause current or communication errors. Is it possible to have a product support engineer either visit the site or remote in for us? I believe Erick can connect to the machine and allow someone to view things remotely. Thanks, Cooper

My understanding is that the MXH can help us convert that signal to what we need. Can you please confirm? Can you give us a quote for two of these converters and lead time? If connecting this to our existing system, will I also need a shorter encoder cable as well? David/GTS, Any chance you guys might have one with feedback option E7,E8, E9, or E10 in stock?

I hope that’s clear enough, but let me know if you need more information to be able to help me out. Is there a COTS cable that Aerotech makes that could do this 26P to 9P conversion so that we can plug into the XR3i?

Check out pages 4147 for the different available options. https://www.aerotech.com/wpcontent/uploads/2025/02/BMBMSSeriesHardwareManual.pdf !image.png\ thumbnail! The E2000 encoder is a bit of an oddball... we don't sell those often with the nema23 motors. E2500H, E1000ASH are much more common. Small bend radius, continuous flex integral cables are available, too.... in any length that you want. The default is nonflex, 380mm long. From a cost perspective, our BMS\ https://www.aerotech.com/product/bmsseriesbrushlessslotlessrotarymotor/ motors have increased at a much higher rate than the other family of motors, the BM\ https://www.aerotech.com/product/bmseriesbrushlessrotarymotor/. Bm130 has a lower back emf, lower inertia, but does require more current to output the same amount of torque (compared to BMS100). BMS motors are slotless and have the best (lowest) torque ripple, with the tradeoff being torque. BM motors are more traditional steel slotted motors and have more torque density at the expense of smoothness. Justin, Could you please dig up the specification on these two custom motors? I'm not sure if you have bought them since I took over for Tim.

Description: Hi Steve, We’ve had an ongoing issue with our old PlanarDL system with discrete XC2 drives where it loses comms regularly. We’ve been through various diagnostics in the past but haven’t managed to resolve it. One thing we’d like to try is to change the hyperwire cable and/or card. We bought but haven’t installed yet a 2nd PlanarDL with an XR3 controller. I planned to use the cable and card from that system to see if this fixed the issue however I can’t seem to find any hyperwire hardware in the boxes. I presume this would have shipped with this. Do you have any hyperwire cards/cables on hand in the UK that we can order? Regards, Graeme

Summary: Unusual rashes position error in the process of the x axis
Description: Hello everyone, we put the ISA 16 axis system into operation. During our outflow tests, we noticed that the Xachse at the top makes 20 cm noises. We also see a slight rash in the Velocity Error in the digital scope at this point, which is transferred to the yachse (see appendix). These rashes are within our tolerances. How would you classify this behavior? Is to be expected that the axis remains so stable or can there be a deterioration? We greased the axis and cleaned the glass scale, but noise was audible. Since this only affects a small area of the axis, we also assume that the tuning has no influence here, which has been confirmed after a new tuning. Sincerely, Clemens Wiedenhöft

Summary: Changing the axis speed during movement
Description: I would like to know if it is possible to change the speed of the axis while it is already moving. In the project, I'm using the NdriveHPe20IOMXH-S and the software in version 5.03.002. The idea is to make the axis move to position X and, every Y seconds, update the speed. I tried to do this using a while loop, but the program gets stuck on the command until the axis movement is finished. I've seen that there are some functions for position control based on an analog input. The goal would be the same: follow an analog input, but instead of controlling the position, control the speed.

Summary: Pneumatics for WS* axis system hose
Description: Hello aerotech service team. We have a problem again. If the pneumatics is connected (CDA and Vacuum), the axis system for the WST axis seems to be partially broken, when moving WSX, the WST will rub against the granite, which turns it. It is also a bit more difficult to punch than usual. If we do not connect the vacuum, then the problem does not seem to be available. Furthermore, the brake cannot be operated via the valve ((for this I have the assumption that the valve is not properly connected here again.) Many greetings Martin Bauer

Summary: Scanner axes drive to a final switch
Description: Dear aerotech team, after a long time we have reinstalled the scanner AGV14HPRSE515MPWC into our system (it is one of 2 possible scanners which can be installed on the system; axis designation: XR and XR). The associated module is the NMARKGCL. The scanner in question had already been used on this system in the past. We had taken care of loading a file in the Confiuration Manager in which the configuration of these axes was stored. We had also tried several, with a constant result: Press (“Enable” in the user interface or in the digital scope) of the scanner axes (XR, YR) moves the mirror belonging to the axis at the moment into an extreme position and a position error for the axis is displayed. Sometimes an amplifier error is also displayed, but I also did not find out under what conditions after repeated trying (restart, controllereret, order, etc.). If you could help us remove the error, we were very connected to you. MfG Alexander Kratsch Ps.: Mr. Jäger is probably the best contact here, since, according to my information, he was responsible for commissioning the system.

Summary: PSO Output via auxiliary encoder marker +/- on XC4 odd
Description: Hello support team, we’ve an urgent issue with a system recently delivered to Korea and currently installed by a colleague. We’re using the PSO output over the auxiliary encoder marker / to trigger our laser as we’ve done for many years. On that system we experienced a laser continuous firing issue which damaged the laser fiber. First we suspected a wiring issue but it was found to be correct. Our colleague on site tested everything down to the PSO interface with a multimeter connected to PSO(pin20) and PSO(pin19). He found that the PSO output goes to 5VDC on a PSOCONTROL <ax> RESET command which is different to what we are used to. He tested on drivers XC4 SN 41489507 and SN 41116508 with the same behavior. Installed AeroTech A3200 software and firmware is 6.04.009.0008. I’ve reproduced the measurement on one of our systems with AeroTech A3200 software and firmware is 6.04.009.0008 as well as firmware 6.04.007.0017. Both behave same with driver XC4 SN501221-06 but different to the system in Korea: After power up or during AeroTech controller reset I also see 5VDC between PSO pins 20/19 but as soon as the SMC real time starts, this signal drops to 0.3 VDC which is fine as the laser won’t fire. Could you please confirm there is no hardware or firmware difference between the drivers? What could be the reason for this odd behavior? Could there be some electrical defect or some unknown parameter which affects this? Thanks for any help or hint\\! Best Regards, Thierry

Description: Dear Support Team, currently i’m trying to setup or migrate the stages of a system from A3200 to Automation1. Currently i’m struggling with the issue that one of Axis can not be enabled using the enable Button in the Jog Window below. The Axis is a Yaw Axis which is connected to a Roll & Yaw Goniometer from Huber and is motorized by a Stepper Motor “Orientalmotor PKP244D15B2” with Renishaw Tonic Analog Encoder. Problem: The Axis can not be enabled by clicking on the Enabled button, it stays disabled and even doesn’t show any Error Message. The refered Controller of the Axis is shown in the current electrical device configuration. And its getting encoder Feedback, which was tested by manually moving the axis. The Axis parameter were used as before in A3200 and the machine setup configuration including the bus voltage setup was done after migrating in Automation1. This Problem occurs on two Goniometer Axis stacks, both on the Yaw Axis. Do you have any explanations for it or similar causes in the past? Would be nice if you could give me remote support or some quick guiding via Message

Summary: Amplifier Fault, NDriveCP20IOMXU
Description: Hello everyone, during an editing yesterday an A3200 module issued an “Amplifier Fault” and the processing had to be stopped. I was able to acknowledge the error and then use the axes as usual. After that, we also had the same processing run through again without the error occurring again. The documentary in the NVIEIE says that the amplifier fault can be triggered if the current is too high, but we were unable to observe any streams larger than 3a during processing (Peak Current from the module is 20a). How could the mistake: "Amplifier fault" have been triggered? What measures should we take now? Do we have to exchange the NDRIVE module (the module was only exchanged for almost a month ago)? We use the following NDRIVE: NDRIVECP20IOMXU with S/N: 675011/2 Thank you for your answer. Sincerely, Tjabbo Reinhardus

We'll get into more strenuous qualification soon. I wanted to ask if you could send us a quote for a license to upgrade our controller to the IE2 option? I'd like to use EtherCAT for higherlevel system integration. Also, I did not find in the schematics that an external power supply is required to power the brakes. While it is mentioned in the drive manual, I think it would be helpful to have something in the drawings. If it was there and I missed it, please let me know!

Do you have any idea what the country of origin is or was that can be tied to this part(s)? This is the information that I have on the part below:\ I did find some history that showed an obsolete part tied to this part, which is obsolete pn MO63B.

Summary: Synchronizing analog output to axis movement at high frequencies
Description: Hello, I am looking for a technical solution of synchronizing analog output to axis movement at high frequencies. From the software perspective, there are several possible approaches, e.g., tracking the required axis movements in a certain task and converting them to the required analog output. The problem is that Aerothec controllers have a small limit on how often the analog value is updated on devices. According to the specifications, this is a maximum of 1 kHz. However, I need a significantly higher analog output update frequency, say around 500 kHz. A quick search shows the existence of devices that may help https://www.usdigital.com/products/discontinuedproducts/discontinuedinterfaces/edac2/\ https://www.usdigital.com/products/discontinuedproducts/discontinued-interfaces/edac2/, where it would be possible to feed an axis encoder into the box and get an updated analog output up to 400 kHz. Does Aerotech have similar devices, or are there alternatives or suggestions for solving similar tasks? Thank you in advance. Best regards, Žygintas

Recently, there was an out of box issue with the ES149332001 system from sales order 629737. This system arrived with a short vacuum cable (ES14933370) that was unable to be routed into your chamber. After reviewing the drawing for the system (ES14933-715), we would like Applied Materials to define how much cable length is required to exit from the end of the stage to properly route in the chamber. Once we have this dimension, we can check each system before shipping to ensure this problem does not happen again. There are a few notes on the drawing, but nothing specifically defines the length we need. I have included an image of the system with a note pointing to where we would like the cable length defined from. Please provide an acceptable range of cable length that is required to exit the stage from our designated point for routing into your chamber. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you, Jean Starr Applications Engineer

In the pdf document attached, I have delineated the steps undertook so far to interface, control & characterize the BM75 via the EPAQ-R controller & software. I would like your input, if this is the appropriate procedure to follow covering the following points: # How do we ascertain that the motor well tuned? Is there a way to tune the motor acceleration/deacceleration as it approaches the preset rotation speed? # Is there a way to run the motor continuously at a prescribed rotation speed with an external signal to START/STOP the rotation? I will ask further queries in due course as we navigate the system at our end. e.g. How does adding a load change the motor response and how should this be addressed? Thank you for your time.

Summary: Hitting lower hard stop for Z axis
Description: On our 7 axis stage (X, Y, Z, ROT, TILT, PX, and PY) we are considering a procedure that would drive the Z axis into the lower hard stop once when we power up the stage the first time. It would never happen again after that. The Z axis is driven with a linear motor with a wedge type actuation. The AverageCurrentThreshold is 1.55 A and the MaxCurrentClamp is 10 A. DefaultAxisSpeed is 2 mm/sec. If we drive the Z axis into the lower hard stop, do we risk damaging anything or causing anything to go out of alignment? Cameron Daugherty is intimately familiar with this stage, so he should be able to help answer this question.

Summary: Axes fallback to Virtual if communication with Drive cannot be established
Description: Good evening. SO #637477 We currently have systems that use a PC based controller (we are installing a Hyperwire PCIe card into our own PC), and a few different configurations of drives depending on the system we are building (including XC4e, XC2, and/or a GL4). We had an issue last week after a wiring change, where an RCD breaker had tripped upon a system restart, which ended up removing controller and motor power from all of the Aerotech drives. When our software was restarted, we were able to initialize the Aerotech motion controller normally through the .NET API without any problems, and were able to enable, home and execute motion commands as expected. However, the system wasn’t working correctly, and we eventually discovered that the stages were not moving, even though move commands to the controller were being processed without error, and axis positions were being updated. After some troubleshooting, we discovered that the drives were without power, but it seemed that the controller had started, noticed the missing drive units, and defaulted to setting up each axis a s a virtual axis. We were able to reproduce this error again later and see the same effect. With Automation1 running when restarting the controller in this state, a Warning message appeared but all axes were configured as virtual, and appeared to operate as normal but with no actual motion. With the first drive unit in the Hyperwire daisy chain powered, but all others powered off, no warning was issued, but all “missing” drives were silently configured as virtual. Is this the expected operation? It seems very dangerous to implicitly set a configured drive to operate virtually when the drive cannot be found – my expectation is that this would generate an error. Can the controller be configured to alter this behaviour, such that an error is reported, and axes are not silently set to virtual if the relevant drive cannot be detected? We did see that a workaround exists that allows you to detect if an axis is being reported as Virtual, because the AxisStatus item for an axis includes a NotVirtual flag that reports that state, but it seems strange to me that this is something that a user has to explicitly check each axis for.

Summary: Amplifier fault error
Description: Hello Aerotech support, We are having trouble with a machine that is getting an ‘Amplifier fault’. We have seen this issue intermittently on other machines in the past (a few months ago) but on those machines the error seemed to stop. This machine is consistently getting this error (every few hours). Is possible to get the subcode that triggered the fault? If you can provide information on that it would be helpful. There doesn’t seem that it was triggered by an overcurrent or over temperature, so it is unclear as to what triggered the fault. I have attached the information that the controller gathered when the fault occurred. There doesn’t seem to be a reason for the fault to have occurred on the Yaxis. The current seems to be low and it doesn’t seem that there would be a temperature issue. The controller is an iXC4 PN: Automation1iSC4e10EB1MX3PSO1SX0 and the SN: 439981-01. I am trying to get more information using the DriveDataCaptureOn() and DriveDataCaptureOff() but it doesn’t seem to work if a trigger is not configured (I was using the PSO to trigger in the past). Is there a way to configure it to start capturing without waiting for a trigger? Thank you, Curt Curt Behrend, Embedded Software Engineer 3D Systems , 16550 West Bernardo Dr., Building 5, Suite 500, San Diego CA 92127, USA !image001.png\ thumbnail!

Description: Moving the Y axis through A1 at 25mm (between positive values and 24mm seem to be OK) the current spikes and faults with Position Error Fault. May to occur at ~-86mm as well. Manually moving the stages with them disabled seems to be smooth with no interference.

Summary: Z axis errors
Description: We are unable to home the Z-axis, as it appears the homing distance is set beyond the travel limit. The stage does not detect the end of travel and continues beyond it, resulting in a position error fault. I have attached a video, data visualizer, and the .mcd file we are using on this system. Could you please guide us on troubleshooting this error and setting the home parameters on this drive?

Summary: Encoder for PRO165LM stage
Description: Hello, we have a very quick question regards the encoder of Aerotech linear stage, model PRO165LM0250ES17488, which we are trying out to use external drives to control. The encoder signals are analog (i.e., not TTL voltages) but not exactly sinusoidal when the stage moves, but rather look like square wave signals, and we are unsure how to conduct the encoder interpolation for such signals. It would be fantastic if you could help providing information or guidance on this. Thank you\\!

Summary: Zero location of the R axis on Orca Stage
Description: Hello Aerotech Support, I was notified that our sample rotation was off on several tools for the Orca Stages. For reference, a serial number of one of the stages is 63110911. The problem didn’t occur on this stage but it should help you find the stage model. My question is about how the zero position of the ROT is set. In the screenshot below, the topplate is in the 0 position. How accurate is this 0position set on a new stage? Is it set by adjusting the PrimaryAbsoluteFeedbackOffset in the MCD file or is it a physical adjustment of the encoder ring scale on the R axis? !image001.png\ thumbnail! Thanks, Jake

Summary: Encoder fault
Description: From Sales: Dave emailed me and said, "The stage has now completely stopped working—the encoder sensor shows a red light and we can’t clear a fault. I suspect this is all related to an incident that occurred when another researcher used the stage and dropped a bar that was used to flatten a sample onto the frame – that must have damaged the encoder and maybe loosened the sensor. " Can you reach out to Dave to troubleshoot or determine if an RMA is needed?

Summary: Linear Axis Load Cell One-Way Movement Interlocking
Description: Hi, SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT: We need a configurationonly method to create a oneway interlock that blocks positive axis movement while allowing negative movement when a load threshold is exceeded. System Details: Automation1 with XR3 drive rack Load cells providing 010V analog signals on lathe and linear axes Already utilizing the "external fault parameter" Current Implementation Issue: We've implemented the external fault parameter to trigger when our load cell analog input exceeds our threshold. This correctly stops axis movement for safety, but it blocks movement in ALL directions. Critical Requirement: The system MUST allow operators to move in the NEGATIVE direction even when the threshold is exceeded (to "back off" from the pressure point), while maintaining the block on positive movement. Important Constraints:* # This must be achievable through system configuration ONLY # We cannot use Aeroscript or any programming solutions # The interlock must function globally regardless of which program/task is running # The solution should be similar in function to endoftravel limit switches (which allow movement away from the limit but not toward it) Are there specific parameters, settings, or configuration combinations in the Automation1 system that would enable this directionselective interlock behavior?

I decided to check the Easytune feature to see if there was an issue with the tuning of the stage and I got the message below. When I try to home with the automation1 I can see the Y axis tries to move and then it stops and nofault flags, we just cannot move it. I am using an .MCD we used for a previous stage, same type of stage and at that moment it worked without issues. We do not understand as of why this could change. Does this mean that we have to do a Machine Setup for every stage? I am just trying to understand what the issue is since there could be no fault for it. !image.png\ thumbnail!

Summary: Loud screeching noise when homing X and Y axis (Aerotech A3200)
Description: Hello, My name is David Girard. I am working under the supervision of Dr. Arnaud Weck. We have noticed an issue lately when using our Aerotech system. When we home the X or Y axis, a loud screeching noise is produced. When homing the X axis, the noise is quieter, but the system still manages to home the axis. When we are homing the Y axis, the noise is very loud, and the homing does not complete. An “Overcurrent Fault” appears on the X axis, and when we try to reactivate the X axis, the screeching noise continues until another overcurrent fault occurs. To stop this, we need to deactivate the Y axis and set it manually to the center. Here is some useful information about our system: Controller: Npaq X stage: ANT 130XY Z stage: ANT 130V The configuration file is attached to this email. We have tried the following things: Reduce the homing speed from 20 mm/s to 10 mm/s Perform EasyTune Restart the controller Remove anything on the stage Let us know what you think might be the issue. We can also send more information if you need. Best regards, David

When I try to jog the motor there is a delay of a few seconds from the time I click my mouse to the time the XProbe axis starts to move. This delay happens regardless of the jogging velocity that is selected. When the XProbe axis moves, its velocity is not linear and smooth like the YProbe. If you hold down the jog button for a few seconds, the axis will move after a delay and exponentially accelerate and overshoot its intended position. After homing the XProbe it slowly drifts from its position by tenths of mm and never really settles into a final position. We request live online support to resolve this issue.

We’ve tried several combinations of parameters in the software and cannot sustain motion with the motor without “Overcurrent Fault” being raised by the drive, sometimes without motion whatsoever, sometimes with brief, quick motion, sometimes with extended but slower motion. The documentation isn’t very helpful in deciphering the meaning of changing certain parameters and we're at a loss as to how to proceed. The motor is a brushless DC motor with 4 pole pairs, the windings are arranged in a delta configuration. Position feedback is a resolver that is processed by a third party hardware unit into quadrature, we have confirmed that the feedback is functional and nominally accurate. Please advise on next steps or if we can provide additional information or jump on a call, thank you.

Summary: Axis moves during Automation1 reset if HomePositionSet param. is not 0
Description: Hello, I’ve recently realized that on our stages, an axis will report an incorrect position under the circumstances described below. Please note that all of our axes have absolute encoders, so it could be that this is not an issue with incremental encoders. # The axis must have a value other than 0 for the HomePosiitonSet parameter and it must be configured in flash, e.g., 1 mm. # Move the axis before proceeding to the next step, e.g., move to 10 mm. # Record the current position of the axis as shown in A1 Studio, e.g., for this example I would record 10 mm. # Disable the axis. # Reset A1. # Now the axis position reported in A1 Studio will have changed by the amount specified for the HomePositionSet parameter. However, the axis will not have moved. In this example A1 Studio would show 9 mm. # Enable the axis. The position immediately changes to the value it had before the reset. Again, the axis did not move. In this example, the axis would now show 10 mm. For our particular application this is an irritating problem that I can describe fully if you wish. I realize it’s easy to work around by simply enabling an axis after doing a reset. Is there a better way to work around this issue? Thank you, Dave Jasa

I’m looking for corresponding setup on the Automation1 and so far the help is not enough to get functioning encoder signals out. I’ve checked the wiring and it’s the same between the 2 drivers on the 9pin HD so the problem is not our hookup. I’ve been able to get all the signals to get turned on high or low but can’t get the output to function as normal for the encoder outputs. There are several differences, and it’s not clear what the correct setup should be to give us the same functionality we had before. Attached is a screenshot from Automation1 for the parameters I’ve tried to port over. I can’t find anything in the IO config which is analogous to the A3200 but maybe that’s gone now? Really need help here to get this going. I’d prefer not to have multiple email exchanges over days to get this going.

I assume it is the PSO output port, which seems to require a few programming steps to obtain the appropriate signals, which I am in the process to understand 😉.

Summary: MP - LLNL A3200 Migration and Motor Current Error
Description: Hello Support Team, I'm looking for help validating system compatibility and also troubleshooting a motor supply error that’s come up during setup. Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL) came to us with several existing hardware components and asked for assistance in building a new system. I wasn’t given the full background on where the components came from or how they were used previously, but based on what was available and their desired direction, we moved forward with a solution centered around an iXC4e drive and the Automation1 platform. I’ve attached a spreadsheet including the components in question. The customer provided a .prma file from their previous A3200 system and is hoping to migrate it into their new Automation1 setup. However, since I don’t have confirmation on the original system's details, I’m not able to validate whether this is feasible. I’ve attached the file for reference could you review it and let us know if it qualifies for migration under the Automation1 guidelines? Regarding the cable and connection setup, the customer did some initial testing of their existing ANT130 stages with an XC4e drive prior to ordering the new Automation1 components. During this testing, they claimed to have used cable C2452150, which engineering explained is associated with an XR3 controller (MPI6820\ https://tracker.aerotech.com/browse/MPI6820). They also recommended the C1898250, for the XC4es which is consistent with what the cable configurator specifies for the new setup. That said, I want to flag a point of confusion from the documentation: the ANT manual lists 80 VDC on CN1 and 160 VDC on CN2, but the configurator allows CN1style cables to be selected with XC4e. I’d appreciate clarification here—not just to resolve the question, but also to rule out whether this could be contributing to the motor supply error they’re seeing. Apologies for the long note—I wanted to make sure everything was explained clearly. Please feel free to respond here, ping me, or give me a call at (724) 9531381 if you’d like to talk through any of this live. I’m available the rest of today and all day tomorrow.

Summary: Is it possible to update the CommandPosition for a disabled axis?
Description: I would like to update the PositionCommand for a disabled axis without actually moving the axis. Is this possible? If so, how would I do it? The rest of this request explains why I want to do this. We have a stage that consists of a long linear motor axis, with a short travel piezo motor axis parallel to the long axis and mounted on top of the long axis. The long axis is commanded to move to position, disabled, braked, and then the short travel piezo axis is commanded to a position that is equal to the position error of the long axis. This is necessary because applying the brakes on the long axis causes position displacement. So the PositionFeedback of the long axis plus the PositionFeedback of the short axis should equal the PositionCommand of the long axis. If a very short move is required, we move only the short travel axis. This is done to improve throughput. But now, the PositionCommand of the long axis no longer equals the PositionFeedback of the long axis plus the PositionFeedback of the short axis. Usually this is not a problem, but I recently ran into a situation where it is a problem. Ideally I would like to programmatically change the PositionCommand of the long travel axis without enabling the long travel axis. Thank you, Dave Jasa

Summary: Stepper motor not reaching position
Description: Hi Sidney, It seems that if we have some load on the motors and it is missing some steps, then it doesn’t get to the target position. At the end of the move the commanded position is sometimes about 3 mm from the current position if there is enough load on the motor to cause it to miss steps. It seems like if the stepper motor is operating in closed loop mode, the actual position would be closer to the target position. Is there something that needs to be done to configure the stepper motor and encoder to operate in closed loop mode? Thank you, Curt

Summary: Dual Axis Ensemble Focus arm controller
Description: Hi Tom, I have a Dual ensemble controller that a test system the systems team uses to move the focus arms on their rate table. Ce communicate with it via the LAN interface but it has stopped communicating. I think the IP address might have changed on it. IF not the Ensemble may have broken down. I think the Testing software was lost for it. (The original person that set up the station predates me) Would it be possible to gat a copy of the software for that station? Best Regards, Kyle Taylor Lockheed Martin Kyle, The best thing would be to get a case going with our service department. They handle these types of post sales issues as well as new copies of the software. The link below my signature takes you to their service portal. Once you make a case, they will contact you. They will want to know the old sales order number which would be the same as the serial number on the controllers. Tom Markel Hi Tom, I think I was able to find the software version CD that was used. (At least I was able to communicate through USB with one of the Ensemble CP10(s). I got the Optical axis to work so the systems guys are able to limp along. It looks like the Transverse axis Ensemble CP 10 is not able to communicate via USB or Ethernet. The Ensemble Configuration Manager was not able to see the Unit either standalone or when connected with the working (Optical Axis) ensemble. I am thinking the unit communication port died. What is your opinion? Also, if I use newer Ensemble firmware, can I update the firmware to the newer version Configuration manager without problems? Kyle Taylor Kyle, I would talk to GTS (Service is called Global Tech Support) to see if they can get you reconnected to the drive. Also if you are using Ethernet, you could switch to USB if the Enet port is reeally dead but the drive is still alive. GTS I believe can still make the EnsembleCP10, so they probably can sell you a replacement if it is truly dead. If they do not have any more Ensemble Parts, I'd have to quote you the iXC4 or 4e. I think they have parts, so I don;t think that is needed. Firmware wise, if we sent you a new drive, GTS would ask you want version you have. I think 5.06 is the last version before they locked it down. Do you know what version you have? If you have something older, I would probably update both your drives to 5.06 so they are the latest. The configuration manager of 5.06 can update older versions of 5.00 and up to 5.06. Your existing Configuration Manager can only go up to whatever version it is. If you have an older version, say 5.04, you probably could get a new drive with that version from GTS. Tom Markel

No matter how many times I “acknowledge fault” and then “reset” the system this still continues to happen. The servo amplifier for this Yaxis stage is the BA20160S with S/N 60709/85. Notably this problem does not happen to the Xaxis stage. What can I do to fix this amplifier fault? Does the servo amplifier need to be replaced as this system is nearly 25 years old, or is there some other way to fix this problem? Also is there a special diagnostic way to view real time results of the amplifier current and voltage before I enable this Yaxis and then during and after I enable this Yaxis, so I can see how this is changing and ideally compare it to Xaxis stage?

Summary: Soloist controller rules for hardware firewall
Description: Resending my request from 3/6…please let me know if you get this! We have a customer using a Soloist (software ver 5.06 on Win10 Enterprise LTSC) CP10 controller. Their IT is requesting that they put the controller on a different subnet as the control PC and connect through their firewall using a VLAN. I’m not sure this is possible and don’t know all the behindthescenes details of the ethernet traffic required for Soloist to talk to the controller. Here is a screencap of the network traffic that our customer is seeing to try and figure out how to configure the firewall. There is both UDP broadcast on port 32835 as well as BOOTP traffic. I am only familiar with using Soloist Config Manager to first connect to and then set a static IP address that I assume can be used to establish a TCP connection. Is there a way to configure the controller once with a static IP so that only TCP traffic on a specific port needs to be allowed through the firewall after that, or are these other UDP and BOOTP packets required as well once the controller is configured?

It appeared the magnet had moved from its original position and got transferred onto the encoder strip. When the stage traveled over the magnet the indicator light turned red. We removed the magnet since it appeared to be out of place and only barely held in by adhesive. It was very close to a witness mark at about the middle. We homed the axis and it appears to be functioning properly. The light stays blue and briefly flickers green, no longer turns red.

Description: Hi, My team is in the process of purchasing a ViscoTec extruder with our Aerotech XR3 controller, and I would like to confirm the motordriving capabilities of the XR3. From the XR3 Hardware Manual, it appears that the 5pin Motor Output can drive a stepper motor directly. I want to confirm whether this output can alternatively provide STEP and DIR signals. ViscoTec offers two drive unit options for their extruder: Drive Unit A: Accepts two of the four outputs from a stepper driver, along with GND and +24V. Drive Unit B: Accepts STEP and DIR signals. I have attached an abridged PDF outlining the ViscoTec drive input configurations. Could you please confirm whether either of these options will possibly be compatible? Best, Michael Song

Summary: Problems with our Automation 1 Controller Upgrade
Description: Reference: SO 64023211 Hello Katrina, We are now trying to get our stage upgraded with the new Automation1 controller, but we are having problems we hope you can help us with. As a starter can you verify my understanding of 4a below? Here is where we are: # We removed the A3200 controller and all cables from our 2-axis air bearing stage. # We have connected the stage with all the cables provided in the order. # We have powered the two controller/drives. # We downloaded the included MCD files (attached) ## I thought part of our order was to convert the old A3200 prm file to the new MCD format? # Started the Aerotech Automation1 Studio and we can see position feedback on each channel that follows the stage motion (with the drives disabled) # When we enable the X axis, it stays enabled until any disturbance occurs (pressing lightly on the stage) we immediately get a position fault. # When we enable the Y Axis, we can manually jog Y and don't see any faults. ## The axis is not tuned well and buzzes. I expect something is wrong with the configuration or MCD file, but not sure where we should look. We appreciate any insights or suggestions on how to proceed. Best regards Ned Bennett

Summary: Evaluation / repair questions for an XC4e controller
Description: Hello! We had a couple fuses blow on one of our motor controllers and I was curious of the process of repairing the unit and if that's something you guys do. I was wondering if you guys could get us a quote for a new XC4e to replace the broken one as we need the station running ASAP. If you guys do repairs then could you add the repair to that quote? If we were able to get a new one as quick as possible then there would be no rush on repairing the existing one. If it’s something simple, we could also repair the unit in house with some guidance from you guys. Just to confirm though, the A3200 key would still work with a different controller correct? Would it be plug and play to get the system running with a new controller or how does that work? Just for additional info, in the near future we are also upgrading that same station to automation1.

Summary: Feedback characteristics of Piezo substage seems to change over time causing the axis to run out of travel
Description: Hello Aerotech Support, I have a question regarding the feedback of our piezo substage in the Orca Stages. One of the stages in question has the serial number 633957. We have encountered an issue with several stages in production where the PX or PY axis fails to settle at the end of a move or triggers a Position Error fault. Upon investigation, we have discovered that we are unable to drive to 7.5um of the specific axis. It appears that the center position of the feedback has changed. To resolve this, we have adjusted the PrimaryAbsoluteFeedbackOffset parameter to shift the 0 position to the center of the travel range. My question is, what could have caused this change? We don't have any activities that would alter the offset, so the only possible causes seem to be either the piezo flexure or the characteristics of the feedback device. Thanks, Jake

The position feedback is drifting even though the stage is not moving. Having talked to Renishaw technical support, the encoder appears to be in working condition. Using an oscilloscope I am seeing that the SLO signal is following the MA signal and is noisy (see attached image). In the image the green signal is MA while the purple is SLO.

Summary: Unable to log feedback velocity from one of the rotational drive.
Description: Dear Tech Support, We are encountering an issue while logging data from our experiments on the Aerotech A3200 Npaq MR (SN: 19743401) using a task script (attached below as BalarkTask3daq.pgm). The problem arises on line 68 of the script: DATACOLLECT ITEM 9, A, DATAITEMProgramVelocityFeedback This command is intended to log the feedback velocity for stage A, corresponding to the BM75 motor used as the feeder. However, the log shows incorrect values like 0 or 89.99 instead of the expected data. While the position feedback confirms we commanded a constant velocity, the velocity readings from the feeder axis are inaccurate. We’ve successfully logged correct velocity data for the linear axis, but the feeder axis consistently shows these faulty values. I’ve uploaded the log files (spiral1000C.dat and .csv) for your reference. Could you help us understand why this is happening? Secondly, We are also running a second system using Automation1 with an Aerotech Automation1 iXC4 (SN: 39656502), which is experiencing a similar issue. On this system, we have another BM75 motor, and when we execute the following command: if(\\!Automation1StatusConfigAddAxisStatusItem(statusConfigcaptureAerotechData, axisf, Automation1AxisStatusItem_ProgramVelocityFeedback, 0)) The results are the same: the X, Y, and Z linear axes provide correct velocity and position data, while the BM75 motor reports correct position data but incorrect velocity data (again showing values such as 90 or 0). Could you please advise if this is related to a configuration or calibration issue, or if there is another reason why the BM75 motors are not logging velocity data correctly? Any insights or guidance you can provide would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your assistance.

Also, we cannot have two kinds of home routine as changing the home type requires a reset of the controller: very undesirable. Any suggestions? One possible method would be to find the limit switches with .NET code and then home in-place. Is that the recommended method? If so, do you have a recommended script to find a limit switch for an axis?

I have some of the motor specs and the old .prma files and so have gotten some motion. I can’t get autotune to work. Adjustment of the .prma files has improved the linear motion to usability, but I’d like to tune further for faster and more accurate motion (though not absolutely required). The rotation stage seems to be fine. It’s possible that a call with an experienced servo tuner could be the right thing. The old nDrive electronics died from (at least) the caps going bad.

I could output the max amperage by using this command: myController.Information.Drives\\0.Axes\\0.MaximumAmperage instead of : myController.Information.Axes\\"X".MaximumAmperage With that being said the only thing I can do is launch scripts like this: myController.Tasks\\TaskId.T01.Program.Run(@"C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Documents\\\\Aerotech\\\\Ensemble\\\\User Files\\\\TestScript Copy.ab"); the ensemble control software works fine and can control the stages from them. Is there a new dll to use or a firmware update needed? It’s happening to all 3 axis’s that we have. Let me know if you need more information. Thanks, Brandon

Summary: Issues with Hall Effect and OT sensors - Pro225 & Pro115
Description: To Whom It May Concern, I recently reached out to our sales representative for Aerotech (Tyler Aber) and made him aware of some issues we have had with two different linear stages. We originally purchased a Pro225LM, part number PRO225LM0150MT1TT2E2CMS1PL0TAC and installed in onto a machine we were building in 2022. This Pro225LM was extremely oversized for our application, but was midbuild and canceled from the original customer. We purchased this unit in order to fasttrack delivery. Within a few months of installation and commissioning, the halleffect sensors went out. I reached out to technical support and we adjusted the parameters to ignore the halleffects in order to keep the machine running. After the parameters changes the linear stage continued to work properly for another few months, until one of the over travel sensors began to fail. It is currently in operation in this state, no halleffects and one missing OT sensor. Late 2023, we ordered two (2) Pro115LMs, order number 631229/5051 When ordered, we discussed the possibility of replacing the existing 225LM with one of the new units in order to get it serviced and fully operational with all sensors working properly. We have not been able to do this due to production demands. We built a second machine and released it for production early March 2024, in late April 2024 the halleffect sensors began to fail. I remembered how to modify the parameters from this issue on the 225, and made the required adjustments. After this, there was another discussion with Tyler about concerns on sensors and functions. I was assured that he has never heard of this before. As production is running constant, I have not made changes or swapped hardware and the machine continued to run in this state. We have now had two (2) false triggers on the negatrive OT sensor on the installed Pro115LM. Though not a constant issue, my guess from previous experience is that this sensor is beginning to go bad. I reached out again to Tyler to discuss our concerns on equipment sensors, build quality, and reliability. The sequence of events is almost exactly the same from the Pro225LM and the Pro115LM halleffects and OT sensors failing. I still have a new in box Pro115LM for a third machine, but want to address these issues before installing the unit. I asked if it was a possible quality issue on the sensors due to COVID and all the chaos it caused in the indutrial equipment space. Tyler has asked that I start a service ticket and start by providing you the parameter files for both linear stages. You will find them attached to this message. These stages are carrying an approx. 20lb load, they only shift 1.5 inches in max travel (outside of homing) and at a fairly slow speed. They index about once every 15 seconds during a production run. They are positively pressurized with CDA to ensure that dust and environmentals do not get into the cases. Can someone please review the parameter files and then reach out to discuss how we determine the cause of failure in order to prevent repeating these events for a third time?

We tried hard setting the laser, resetting the controller, and Dalton dug into the code. It looked like the error might be related to the safety features in place to prevent an axis from crashing. The second shift engineer informed us the operator running the laser may have accidentally changed the “Z correction value”. What should this value be?

This seems reasonable to me because the galvo alone is listed as weighing 2.6kg/ 5.7lbs... So even if we make the assumption that the Lasermech head weighs the same as the galvo (bringing the weight up to 38.4lbs), we are starting out with a safety factor of ~two ( SF=\\1=1.86).

Summary: Velocity Error Faults on Axis A (ILT Serial # 8718)
Description: Hello Aerotech Team I have a customer that has a rotational axis model AGR50M1ML25LI1T and they are having velocity and position errors. The axis was changed back in early 2024 and was not having any issues with it until two weeks ago. When they changed the axis, they did not run any tuning programs. They used the same parameter file settings they already had. Now they are trying to run the EasyTune application but it cannot be completed due to the velocity and position errors. The email chain also has some more information such as graphs of the axis movement comparison between the A axis and a good axis (B). This is part of the response from the customer (Yellow Highlighted) when I suggested to run the EasyTune application according to the instructions attached in this email. We have attempted to run the Easy Tune tool on axis A but we experience the same velocity error fault during the calibration motion. This occurs at the default settings as well as the recommended settings of 20degrees @ 1/10th speed. We have also attempted to run the Easy Tune at a varying speeds and distances; however, we still experience the same velocity error fault. In addition, I have tried to manually adjust the gain values to maybe get the velocity error to go away long enough for us to run the Easy Tune tool with no success. The last thing we tried was to attempt disable the velocity error by using the A3200 Configuration Manager to set the velocity error threshold to 0 as indicated in the manual. We did this in hopes of allowing us to run the Easy Tune tool without faulting out during the calibration motions, however we still experienced the velocity error fault. I have attached two more digital scope plots to this email for your team’s Investigation. The plots are of the faulty axis A and of the known working axis B. These plots show the position, velocity, acceleration, and current data through 360degree rotation. Axis A did not experience a velocity error fault during this plot and as mentioned in a previous email, we only experience this fault when we are jogging in increments from rest and not when we are making large sweeps of continuous motion. I am curious to know if your team believes that our issues could be due to mechanical degradation in the gearbox/motor. If so, what could have caused it to wear out so soon with such little use whilst also being located in a clean room environment? We have an identical unit in the same room and configuration that has not experienced these issues. Do you believe running the Easy Tune will resolve our issues without needing to replace the whole drive unit? Do you have any tips on getting it to work without triggering the velocity error fault?

Please see the below answers/notes to the feedback provided. When did this problem start to occur? Was it immediately after we changed the axis in early 2024? This issue is a recent one. After replacement of the axis in early 2024, 67 full shop orders were run without issue to verify functionality. This velocity error issue arose around 2 weeks ago during testing and the last active shop order where we utilized this axis was in August 2024. Is this axis in a harsh environment that would accelerate any wear? This machine is located within a clean room environment which rules out any concerns with dust or debris getting into the drive mechanism. In addition, this axis has not seen much use since its installation. As stated above, this drive ran about 67 full shop orders after replacement and the last active shop order was in August. Please make sure the cut is not affecting any of the wires inside that cable. Upon closer inspection of the motor cables, it seems like the damage is to the insulation only and none of the conductors have been damaged.

We have utilized the digital scope program to plot the behavior of the servo motor up to the fault and I have attached the Scope Files to this email for your reference. These graphs were generated using an incremental step of 15 degrees and we have configured the conditional plot logic to change the color of the graph to turquoise when we experience a fault. The file name indicates the number of points, period, and fault position. The graph for 360 degree rotation on Axis A utilized an incremental step for 360 degrees to capture the motor’s behavior when we are moving in a continuous motion. Looking at the graphs of Axis A compared to Axis B, it seems like we are observing a high amount of position and velocity error in the beginning of each incremental step with a large amount of initial overshoot with little to no stabilization over the duration of the step. This leads me to believe we have some sort of tuning error or mechanical friction. Please see the below snippets of the graphs with my observations. (PLOT 1) Axis A: Incremental Jog by 15 degrees. Fault at position of 30 degrees. Here we have a large initial positional error and velocity error during transient response. As the velocity ramps up quickly, we are overshooting the command setpoint which gives us a velocity error in the positive direction. It looks like the drive then tries to drop the velocity to bring us back down closer to the command velocity where we overshoot the negative correction as we approach what would usually be the steady state response of the step. During the steady state response of the step, it seems like we are oscillating heavily when compared to Axis B which is analyzed below. !image003.png\ thumbnail! (PLOT 6) Axis B: Incremental Jog by 15 degrees. No fault Here we have the usual spike of initial error as we begin ramping up to speed and cresting to our command velocity. What we can observe in this graph is that the initial peak of velocity error on axis B is significantly lower at a peak of 3 deg/sec compared to our average peak of about 1215 deg/sec on axis A. In addition, the velocity feedback shows that our correction during steady state response is much smoother and consistent which indicates that we are not significantly over or undershooting the command setpoint during steady state response. !image004.png\ thumbnail! Looking at these graphs it would seem to me like the servo on axis A may need tuning. However, as stated in my previous email, the Gain values Kpos, Ki, Kp, Aff, Vff, and Kpi are identical in all 3 axis. This leads to the following questions: # Are the Gain values for Axis A, B and C standardized to specific setpoints? # Could the reoccurring errors we are experiencing be due to not tuning Axis A after the unit was replaced early 2024? # If the drive was tuned after replacement, would the need to adjust these tuning values indicate some sort of mechanical wear that would require higher/lower gain values to reach steady state with less over/undershoot? # Do you suggest we run EasyTune to get Axis A within tolerance? Would running EasyTune have any risks to bring our machine out of calibration or validation? # Do you have any other observations of the graphs that could illuminate our observed issues? Please let me know if there is anything I can provide for clarification or if you suggest any next steps for resolving our issues.

Regarding attempting to move the axis by hand, we are not able to induce movement in the gearbox by hand for any of the axis’ due to the gearing being too high. This is true for axis A, B and C.

These errors occur both when we are running through a program in automatic mode and when we are jogging the axis manually via the HMI and it seems to occur when we are attempting to move the drive from a stopped state such as after an incremental jog or after we complete a weld routine and rotate our fixture 180 degrees. For what it’s worth, it seems that we are experiencing these faults around the 90degree and 180-degree positions, but this is not consistent and may be purely coincidence. We have attempted to utilize the Digital Scope tool to monitor the velocity, and current command/feedback graphs to try and capture these values when we experience a fault however we do not see any spike in velocity error, nor do we see a spike in position error above our set thresholds. To capture this data we are using conditional plot logic to stop the recording when we see a velocity or position error fault to attempt to capture the values leading up to the fault. I have also looked at the tuning values such as Kpos, Kp, Ki, etc. and have found the values to be identical across all 3 horizontal axis A, B, and C. Our fault thresholds for Velocity and Position are also identical across axis A, B, and C. Could we please get guidance as to where we should direct our focus to? Do you think it is an issue with our setpoints, configuration, tuning? Do you believe that this is caused by some mechanical wear and tear which is leading to resistance. Is there some other factor that we are missing that could be causing our repeated faults on axis A? Please let me know if there is anything else I can provide for further clarification. Thank You,

They shipped controller SN: 47402802 (SXU30 in correspondence with Keller). The controller was delivered to B024 high bay area yesterday 09/10 after lunch and we opened the crate immediately to get started with the EEIP process. The crate did not look damaged, and the controller was snug inside. However, upon visual inspection, we noticed that one of the handles on the controller was bent. Once we opened the controller to perform the EEIP process, Boni (the inspector) noticed a number of components dislodged from the DIN rail support. At that point she stopped work and called us (Cory). Cory and I inspected the dislodged components and noticed that for one component the DIN rail mounting clips are sheared off, while other components are very loose and/or damaged. We also noticed that the DIN rail is deformed. Visual inspection did not show any other damage to the crate, to the controller chassis or the other components inside. Damage seems contained to the bent handle and the components on the one DIN rail. We have not tried powering on the controller. Some pictures of the crate and of the dislodged components are attached. Following up from our discussion earlier today, can you please assist with reaching out to our LBNL and Keller colleagues? We would like to know if Keller has any pictures of the controller before it left their facility. This would be helpful in clarifying whether the handle was already deformed at Keller and if they noticed any rattling noise indicating the components inside the chassis were already not secured upon receipt from Aerotech. Also, can you please reach out to our Accelerator Systems colleagues and let them know? In particular regarding the fact the HESXU000 is again without a controller. Please let us know when you hear back from Giang about formulating a repair plan with Aerotech. Thanks, Alex

Summary: Assistance to close the servo loop on the host side.
Description: Background: # We believe we have now a solid AeroScript code that executes reliable at 1msec interval. We are using a combination of the CriticalSectionStart(), CriticalSectionEnd (), Dwell() functions, and a selection of ExecuteNumLines that results in the 1msec update time. # In the critical section the only thing we need to do is to pass the host demands (position, rate and acceleration) to the controller, and pass the controller’s feedback (position, rate and acceleration) to the host computer. # One restriction from the host, and to be compatible with older Aerotech controller, is that the host demands and controller feedback need to be passed as integers. In the past, these values were in encoder counts. # The critical section of our AeroScript code currently is shown below. Note this: a. Variables $I and $K are the Industrial Ethernet Variables (IEV)of the interface between the host computer and the A1 controller. b. The $I variables are the demand values sent by the host computer c. the $K are the feedback variables to be send to the host. $KHDR = $IHDR // Echo the header counter // Send the demands to the axis... Not sure if this is the right way. MoveFreerun (AZ0, $IVELAZ0) // Set rate demand // Copy the feedback variables to the IEV variables for the host computer to use or log as needed. // Trunc() is NOT the answer, but I can’t find another option $KPOSAZ0 = Trunc(StatusGetAxisItem(AXIS, AxisStatusItem.PositionFeedback)) $KVELAZ0 = Trunc(StatusGetAxisItem(AXIS, AxisStatusItem.VelocityFeedback)) $KACCAZ0 = Trunc(StatusGetAxisItem(AXIS, AxisStatusItem.AccelerationFeedback)) Questions: # In what mode should we put the controller to accept the demand vector (P, R, A)? What command to use? # In what mode should we put the controller to accept the rate demand vectors (R, A)? What command to use? In the code above I am using the MoveFreerun () functions, however it has no argument for the acceleration. Is there another function for this? # For the feedback, are the functions used above “StatusGetAxisItem(AXIS, AxisStatusItem.*)” the appropiate functions to retrieve the feedback? # How can I get the time of the controller?

Summary: Random axis faults
Description: Our ANT130XY’s Xstage is throwing occasional MaxVelocityCommand and PositionError faults apparently at random, and I have not changed the Fault Threshold values from the factorysupplied MCD settings. We need to run longterm (50 hours) processes following a rectangular raster scan path. The stage may move repetitively along the path without problems for many hours, then throw an error. I did not observe this faulting behavior in the months after the initial installation up to a damage incident, which has since been repaired (case GTSE44055). Maybe the axis needs tuning beyond a simple EasyTune, but I lack expertise in this area and only rely on the defaults (8 mm) although the stage travel is 160 mm. Also, I have not been successful in running motor phasing optimizations, always receiving current error faults almost immediately.

Summary: Reversing direction of joystick axis movements
Description: I am wondering if there is a way to reverse the direction of axis movement when using the joystick. I was able to configure the joystick and write a simple AeroScript program to activate the joystick. Everything seems good, except that the axes on the joystick seem to be opposite of what I was expecting. For example, if I map the Z axis to the vertical joystick axis, when I push up on the joystick, the hexapod z axis decreases, and vice versa. Same case if I map X and Y or A and B axes to the joystick. If I push the joystick to the right, the hexapod moves to the left, etc. Is this expected? Is there a way to reverse the axes on the joystick somehow?

Attached are the 2 components I am trying to get to communicate. I can get the Npaq to turn the stepper but periodically it will spontaneously reverse direction. The stepper motor is wired slightly differently than I am used to. Bradley Hi Bradley, I looked into the 24V stepper motor a bit and unfortunately didn't find anything too useful. There was one mention of possibly adding an external 24V power supply specifically for the stepper motor, but otherwise the solution seems to be to use a single axis drive and adjust the AC input to achieve a 24V bus. The Ndrive MP and XC2 drives accept a 24V DC input straight in, and the Nstep and SI4 drives are designed specifically for stepper motors. Tim Youkers Aerotech Global Technical Support Are the voltages from the motor output connections locked into the bus voltage value? I have a stepper motor that only wants a maximum voltage of 24V at a peak current of 0.77A and for the life of me, I cannot find a parameter that lets me alter the voltage value coming from the Npaq.

However, I was able to observe some unusual behavior on the digital scope after a few minutes of operation. Please see the attached plots of the Y-axis bus voltage. These spikes did not cause a fault, but if they were larger in magnitude and lasted for longer I suspect they would. Do you have any insights into the potential cause of this issue?

A while back we had a discussion about the scheme of triggering a home event when a specific following error is achieved. You offered your help and now we are in the good point to get this implemented. This was important for us to enable insitu fixture calibration by creating a zero gap between two plates (one stationary and the other driven). When plates get into contact, the driven plate gets decoupled from the motor, effectively letting the motor move but the encoder that rides on the plate reads a fixed position. This discrepancy should create a following error which we could use for triggering. I already shared a drawing of the setup with you but if you need that again, let me know.

Not sure if you’ve been working with Eric Rowley at all for his “Vitalyst” project on Hydra. We just had the realization that he uses a 5th axis (X, Y, Z, and 2 rotaries). This wasn’t a problem on Hydra 0 with a fully loaded XR3, but production Hydras only have 4 axes. Are we able to steal the 6th axis controller/amp from Hydra 0 and put in Hydra 5?

Summary: Ensemble EPAQ Motion controllers to iXR3 Transition Assistance
Description: Hello, My name is Thaddeus Preston and I am a controls engineer here at Sandia National Labs. I have been given the responsibility of implementation and configuration control of a Legacy system of Ensemble EPAQ Motion controllers. Since they are now obsolete, we have begun the transition to the iXR3s Platform. It is proving to be quite difficult to convert the old parameters for our Axes/Motors to the new .mcd and .param files. Some of the terminology for the parameters are slightly different (or use a completely different lexicon). For organizations such as ours who have these legacy systems, is there a guide, software utility, etc. that can aide us in making this upgrade/conversion? As my team I am now new to this platform, we are interested in any training opportunities that may exist either at Aerotech HQ or possibly having someone come out here to give us some training sessions. Is this a possibility?

Summary: Migration to A1 Thirdparty Stepper Driver On SI4
Description: Hello again, Aerotech Support\\! I’m back with more questions associated with the upgrade project I’ve been working on. Zach has a good understanding of the overall system and application after helping me over the last couple of weeks on (GTSE46578). Is Zach available to help with this ticket, too? :D This calibration system (“SuperCal”) has 3 axes; that ticket was for the first axis (“Theta”) and this ticket is for the second (“Indexing”). “Indexing” is a thirdparty stepper drive (Oriental Motor ARDK) and motor (Oriental Motor ARM46AK) attached to the SI4. The closest I’ve come to “proper motion” is a slight twitch in the motor shaft followed by an assortment of faults as I’ve attempted to sort this out. After several days without progress, I come back to you for help. Of course, I realize this is thirdparty hardware so I don’t expect all of the answers to come from Aerotech. However, the hardware works perfectly with the soontobereplaced A3200based solution so I’m fairly confident the hardware, in and of itself, is not the cause of my continued struggle. I have attempted to transfer all of the relevant parameters into A1 but it stands to reason that I’ve missed at least one thing, because it doesn’t work. I’m hoping you can provide a link to an existing stepbystep tutorial or at least some additional guidance to get me going with implementing a thirdparty stepper driver. Some additional details/notes, below… I created a new Device of type: “Rotary Motor (No Stage)“, in Device Catalog. (Catalog file, “SuperCalAutomation1DeviceCatalog.adc“, attached. “Indexing” was my first stab at the device but I think I found one of my mistakes and created “Indexing v2” and have been using that in my continued testing.) I’ve gone through Machine Setup and assigned “Indexing v2” to the SI4 axis. (“CP3axisiXL5e2April20251319.mcd“ attached) I’ve copied the wiring/pinout previously used with the outgoing A3200/NStep. In addition to my general confusion which would appreciate any additional help, I have a few questions… Questions: # Why is A1 Studio asking about microstepping when all it can do is output one pulse to the drive, commanding it to move one step? # From the help file, “FeedbackInput0” (and 1) Parameter “specifies the feedback input channel to use for servo loop feedback input 0” (and 1). However, there is no servo loop, per se; is there? Yes, there is input to the SI4 from the thirdparty drive but that is only A and B phase square wave encoder outputs wired to the differential Primary Sine and Cosine inputs. I later saw on the SI4 website, “Modes of Operation: Open loop; Closed loop (Pending). I thought only closed loop was servo but, if closed loop is pending, what does the definition for “FeedbackInput0” (and 1) Parameter reference “servo loop”? # I only seem to have an output mode setting (sinking or sourcing) for Amplifier Enable (Configure»Axes»I/O»Outputs»AmplifierEnableOutputMode); not direciton and clock (called “Pulse” on the drive end of the wire). Is there a setting for the other control outputs? Do they always operate in one, fixed way? # The A3200 calls out a pulse update rate at 8 kHz and a max output frequency of 25 MHz. The SI4 only calls out max rate 25 MHz. What is the update rate? ## Configure»Axes»Servo»Outputs»ServoLoopSetup includes an option for 20 kHz (Default) or 10 kHZ PWM Switching Frequency. To which signal is that referering? # Where are all of the MANY stepper resolution parameters documented? There are multiple locations to put the information into A1. I assume I’ve messed up at least one of them. Here are some related parameters, but perhaps I’ve missed others… ## Device Catalog»Device ### Rotary Motor»Full Steps Per Rev ### Feedback»Primary Feedback Resolution ### Feedback»External Stepper Driver Resolution ## Configure»Axes ### Feedback»Feedback»PrimaryFeedbackResolution #### Note: From the help, “The PrimaryFeedbackResolution” specifies the resolution of the feedback device that is connected to the primary input on the drive.” However, the primary feedback is connected to the thirdparty drive. The SI4 is a controller (or an “Interface” according to the website), no? ### Feedback»Multiplier»PrimaryEncoderMultiplicationFactor ## Configure»Axes»Motor ### Motor»MotorPolePitch (I wouldn’t have assumed this was related to encoer and resolution but the help entry for it says, “When the MotorType parameter for this axis is StepperMotor, set the value of the MotorPolePitch parameter to the number of full steps per revolution of the stepper motor.“) ### Stepper»StepperMicrostepsPerStep (microsteps) ## I feel like there was one more but even the above list is long. # Is there any sort of “theory of operation” document I can study to better understand what is actually happening “in the loop” with the SI4 and the thirdparty drive? Specifically, there are multiple levels of feedback and it is not clear how the different components interact. For example, the SI4 sends a pulse to the 3rd party drive, the drive commands the motor however it deems fit, the encoder on the shaft reports back to the drive. I don’t know if that drive duplicates the encoder output or reencodes it based on its own quad decode (or similar), and then the SI4 interprets that as a program position feedback (the field that reports 235x of what I expect). My latest finding was prompted by getting numerous Position Faults when attempting to manually jog “Indexing” in A1 Studio. Even with a Distance Job setting of 0.36 deg, I was getting position faults with a single click. Finally ProgPosFbk (deg) caught my eye. It was reading what seemed to be a random value, often around 12°. I increased my Position Error Threshold (Configure»Axes»Protection»Thresholds»PositionErrorThreshold (deg)) in an attempt to let the controller “finish” without faulting. Sure enough an interesting finding. With the threshold increased to 90°, I was able to click for a single distance jog and here are the results… Set Distance Jog = 0.36° Click jog once ProgPosFbk (deg) displays 85° Interesting. It seems like the feedback/encoder is simply multiplying the input. I wondered if it was linear… Set Distance Jog = 0.15° Click jog once * ProgPosFbk (deg) displays 35° I clicked a second time and wound up at 70°. I can repeat it in reverse and get back to nominally zero and then 35 and 70, and back to zero. So, it is_ linear and repeatable\\! But what does that mean? Now what? I feel like I’m close but I can’t seem to figure out where the 235 multiplier is. (e.g. I say go 1 and it goes 235.) That’s a longer post than I inteded to type so I’ll pause here. Looking forward to hearing from you. As I did with my previous ticket, I’ll post updates if I make progress on my end or have additional information to share / questions. Thanks in advance\\! Charlie

Summary: Damaged Power Sensor
Description: We have ended up damaging the power sensor that came with the machine (see photos attached). This damage is causing our sensor to inaccurately measure the power higher than actual. Comparing to other machines and discussing this with others in the industry, we think that the power sensor is way too close to the beam focal point, and so the focused energy is damaging the sensor. I looked at the machine and there are four bolts holding the pneumatic trolley with the power sensor to the machine. I know that we are constrained with how much room we have due to the moving stage below it, but it seems that we do have a few inches that we can move this down (see photo attached). Can we simply install longer bolts with a spacer to push the sensor further from the beam focal point when measuring power?

Summary: Questions regarding C API for Automation1 controller
Description: I am beginning to port our application which uses the A3200 C API to the Automation1 platform. I have the following questions: # Where can I find the enumerations for the C API error codes. For the A3200, these were found in A3200ErrorCode.h. I do not see a similar file in the A1 MDK, and the enumerations do not appear to be listed in any other header file. # What are the equivalent A1 C API functions for the following A3200 C API functions? ## A3200Reset() ## A3200AcknowledgeAll() ## A3200IsInitialized() # In my initial testing of initiating a local connection, I found that Automation1Connect() takes a long time to return when I run on a machine with no SMC. Where is this timeout defined, and can it be changed? If not, what is the recommended function/code to use to test if the program is running on a PC with no SMC? Our software runs in a simulation mode when there is no connection, and A3200Connect returns immediately with ErrorCodeRegistryError if we try to connect and there is no local SMC. We wish to have similar behavior for our A1 application. # Is there a table (like the table for scripting) that maps the C API calls from the A3200 to the A1 along with any comments about alternatives to achieve the same function? This would be very helpful during the porting of applications which rely on the C API.

Summary: Serial number of the A3200 NPAQ controller unit: 104420-01
Description: Hi, We are thinking about upgrading our system so it is compatible with the new Automation 1 software. Consulting the documentation on the upgrade requirements I noticed that our current A3200 NPAQ driver unit is not compatible with the new software/firmware. Would it be feasible to upgrade to Automation 1 by installing a new driver unit? If so, would it be possible to get a quote for a new driver unit as well as a new industrial PC? We are looking at the XR3 multiaxis drive to replace our existing controller. Would it also be possible to check any compatibility issues that might arise with our current system?

Dear Ramesh, I assume you are looking for the drive and controller for the spindle motor, originally using the Ndrive HPe30. Since the NDrive HPe30I/OMXH is considered a noncurrent product and may soon be EOL, we recommend using the new Automation1 drive for any new projects or repeat system builds. This ensures future availability of spare parts and support. However, if this is only a drive failure requiring a replacement, it may be easier to use the same model—subject to availability. Please confirm whether this is for a new system build or just a replacement drive BTW, the equivalent drive to NdriveHpe30 is Automation1XC4e (see attached spec).

Summary: Automation1 Setting Analog Vector Tracking causes axis deceleration midcoordinated moves
Description: Hello, we are doing laser welding onsite and I have found that changing the Analog Vector Tracking midcoordinated moves is causing a deceleration of the axes that is undesirable. I am attaching logic that is exhibiting this issue. We are also seeing it later at the start of a lead off move where we ramp power down to 0. This is an extremely critical issue as the deceleration will cause a divot in the part. I have also tried to do this without a function call and it still does the deceleration. If I comment out the analog vector tracking line, the deceleration does not happen. This system was updated from A3200 2.55 and the old analog tracking did not exhibit this behavior.

The Y axis faults is "Hall Effect Sensor" and the X axis is "Position Feedback Fault". I have been unable to clear or identify why the faults are occurring. Could I get some phone support tomorrow morning at 19782391800 ? Thx Bill Angell

Summary: Axis stuck in overshot software limit
Description: I set up software limits on an axis with clamping enabled and target scanning disabled. If I execute a move command to/past a soft limit and it’s overshot, the axis will get stuck. You of course can’t move further into the limit, but trying to move out of it will cause the opposing software limit to trigger. For example: SoftwareLimitLow = 10000 SoftwareLimitHigh = 10 executing “moveabsolute(10000)” then yields PositionFeedback = 10000.8 executing “moveabsolute(5000)” causes “CwSoftwareLimitFault” Strangely, the issue only seems to happen if the limit is less than 8000. All of the values I’ve tested below 8000 have this issue while everything I’ve tested -8000 or above behaves as expected. I wasn’t able to drive my axis high enough to seem the limit on the positive end. I’ve also noticed that when the issue is present, AxisStatus.MotionDone is False while it’s True without the issue. Please let me know if I can provide more information. This issue is causing me a lot of trouble so any help is greatly appreciated.

Summary: 3 axis stage repeatedly becoming unstable in X-axis regardless of tuning
Description: Hello, We are having an issue with a 3axis stage that becomes unstable over time in just the Xaxis. Things we have tried to resolv this: Leveled our chamber to make sure the stage was not fighting some gravitational pull. Checked our wiring bundle to make sure excess force is not being distributed onto the stage. * Tuned the stage many times using easytune. What happens is I will use easytune to stabilize the stage but over time the stability deteriorated. This has been documented thoroughly and i would love to share my data over a call. Moving forward i will need assistance in tuning to hopefully resolve this issue. Best, John Tobie EUV Tech

Summary: Help regarding auxiliary encoder interface for iXC2 controller
Description: Hi Aerotech Support, I am using a Automation1iXC210EB1MX0PSO1 interfacing with a BM75D25E2500H3.8 motor and I'm trying to echo the encoder signals onto the "AUX" port (9pin microD connector). The documentation is a little unclear to me on how to configure the controller to echo the encoder values. It has something to do with DriveEncoderOutputConfigureInput(). I tried the following program in Aerotech Automation1 Studio on the motor to echo those encoder values: program // Enable and home the axes. Enable(AZ) Home(AZ) // this should echo the encoder out of the auxiliary encoder DriveEncoderOutputConfigureInput(AZ, EncoderOutputChannel.AuxiliaryEncoder, EncoderInputChannel.PrimaryEncoder) // move forwards MoveFreerun(AZ, 360.0) end The motor is moving as expected. I measured pins 2 and 3 out of the AUX port (Aux Cosine signals) but I only got static voltages that are sitting at about 3V for signals (common-mode is 3V, no differential voltage). Could you please advise on how to configure the motor controller to echo the encoder outputs or why it's not working for me? Thanks, Max

Summary: Position Axis Fault during Circular Motion / Normalcy
Description: Hello, I am attempting to use aerotech stages configured in Normalcy mode (e.g., NORMALCY U AXES X Y) to trace a full circle using the G2 I J K method. I am commanding circular motion in the XY plane, with expectation that the normalcy axis will follow as prescribed by the controller. I am working in G90 mode. First, I am issuing a LINEAR command to move to the startpoint of the circle (e.g., LINEAR X30 Y30). Next, I am issuing a G2 command (e.g., G2 X30 Y-30 I30 J0) to command full circular motion. I am specifying I and J as incremental offsets (i.e., I am not using G118). Upon execution of the G2 command, a runtime error is encountered: the X axis issues an axis position fault. Neither the X or Y axes appear to move during the G2 command. The normalcy axis does move and continues moving despite the presence of the axis fault. The feedrate is slow. I have tried several different types of G2 motion, all resulting in X and/or Y axis position faults. With the many known potential sources of error in Normalcy and G2 methods, I’m not sure of the most effective way to debug this error. Help would be much appreciated. Thank you\\!

Summary: AeroScript Dynamic Configuration of Automation1 Drive
Description: Hello, Our application potentially will allow the use of one of two similar, but different motors in our application to allow for configuration flexibility and obsolescence risk management. We would like to be able to provide a seamless experience for our operating staff with our software, so we would like to accommodate the use of either motor with the drive we’ve purchased without having to use Automation1 to load separate MCDs. Our system currently does not use the APIs in our end-user software, we have created a custom "ASCII Interface" with a task on the drive which interprets “commands” for the client software and runs some custom AeroScript. AeroScript seemingly allows most parameters to be set, but we are having trouble with two (screenshot provided for context): MotorPolePitch LinearAmpVoltageClamp Is there another means to potentially alter these parameters dynamically using AeroScript or some other drive/software feature? Additionally, the older AeroBasic language allowed for resetting the controller which seems to be absent in AeroScript. Is there an alternative for this as well?

So I went into the setup and was trying to change it with very little luck. So I duplicated the outer T stage and then I set it to channel 5 like the old G whatever it was. When I hit save and the controller rebooted, now I get the message attached and it will not let me get into setup. Any ideas?

Summary: ES19658 Z axis limit board sensor question
Description: We are trying to understand the root cause for some stray light produced by our stage. During troubleshooting we have identified that for several of the axes, unplugging the feedback cable has a measurable impact on the stray light detected. 1. We are looking for details on the limit and feedback sensors used on the Z axis of our stage. We want to understand the specifics of both the limit flag sensors and the encoder. I am attaching the relevant system document containing the Z axis in question. The Z axis is largest single producer of stray light from the stage. I need the part number of both the limit sensors and the encoder. 2. The same question for the limit and feedback sensors used on the Sx and Sy sensors. Unplugging their feedback cables also affects the measured stray light, but to a far lesser extent than the Z.

Summary: Ensemble QLAB Motor and Feedback Connections Pin 22 (position feedback)
Description: Hi, Hope this message finds you well. I am using a Ensemble QLAB to drive piezo voltages and would like to know information about the position feedback pin on the motor and feedback connection. Is this a input or output pin? And if it is an input what kind of signal does this return? For context, I am using three piezos to actuate a mirror and measuring the tiptilt angle by measuring the deflection of a laser off the mirror surface onto a 2D position sensor. I would like to use a signal from the aerotech to provide a setpoint for a PID circuit and in combination with the position sensor outputs to send a feedback signal into the QLABs Joystick X,Y & Z connections, to make a closedloop position feedback system to control the piezo motion. Let me know your thoughts. Kind Regards, Kamran

Summary: calibration file for encoder feedback gains
Description: We own a ABL15050WB stage. It seems that the tracking performance of the stage can be improved significantly by tuning the feedback interpolation gains. Unfortunately, the encoder is not uniform across the entire range of travel. This means that the feedback interpolation gains only improve performance of the stage at specific locations. Is there a way to construct a calibration file that can apply unique feedback gains to different sections of the encoder to optimize tracking performance throughout the full range of the stage?

Summary: Question about driving a stepper motor with XC2 drive
Description: Hello, I am trying to configure the XC2 drive to use with a stepper motor. There does not seem to be much to configure but I have changed: MotorType = StepperMotor ServoLoopSetup=Current Command Outputs StepperHoldingCurrent = .5 StepperMicrostepPerStep = 200 StepperRunningCurrent = 1.5 CountsPerUnit = 2000 (units are set for mm). The stepper motor has 1.8 degrees/step. The motor supply has 48 V DC input. If I then tell it to do a 5 mm move (using the Aerotech Automation1 Studio), then I think this would cause a move of 10000 units which cause a move of 50 full steps which would be a 90 degree rotation. But when I do that, I don’t seem to see any motion. Do you have any additional information on driving a stepper motor? Any ideas on what I am doing wrong?

Summary: Automation1 iXL5e Drive PSO Troubleshooting
Description: Hello, We have been attempting to utilize the PSO feature on our drive and have gotten rudimentary functionality, but are having trouble with some of the details… Here is the main context, we are trying to output 3600 discrete pulses per revolution of the motor that is synchronized with the marker pulse of the motor. The motor is intended to be used in continuous motion for long periods for time (e.g.: a few hours). The motor is has a resolver type encoder that is being fed into a thirdparty resolvertodigital encoder unit (this one specifically: https://vegacnc.com/hardware/resolvertoencoder/vega2796500/\ https://vegacnc.com/hardware/resolvertoencoder/vega2796500/). We have set the third party unit to report 8000 pulses per revolution (in quadrature encoder format) to the Automation1 drive. On the drive, we have some code written to utilize the PSO functionality (attached PSO Code.txt). We have three primary issues: # Since the math to get down to 3600PPR ultimately goes to integers, we seemingly will not be able to meet even timing between pulses for a full revolution. Is there a workaround that might enable a smoother pulse rate? Given that smooth motion is not guaranteed in the end application, we’d like to remove as much jitter as possible from the baseline. # Attempts to synchronize the first pulse of the PSO output with the marker pulse has resulted in a strange issue. If we set the first value in the PSO data array to 0, the PSO firing will not reset at the marker pulse and stops firing. Is this intentional in the behaviour of the drive, or is there a setting or piece of code we might be missing? Screenshot from logic analyzer attached which shoes the PSO output (top) and the marker pulse (bottom) showing a configuration that does NOT use 0 as the first pulse output and shows the pulse timing differential between the marker pulse and the first PSO output. # When we command Abort() it seems to also disable the PSO output, which for the time being means our developer needs to go back into drive software to rerun the task to rearm the system. Is there a setting or recommended code to prevent the PSO from needing to be reprimed after Abort() is called? Please let me know if I can provide any contextual information. Regards, James Lui

I looked into the Modbus set-up for both the PLC (as Master) and iXA4 (as Slave), but am having difficulty in setting up the memory allocation and how to pass data from the iXA4 to the PLC (like motion completion). On the PLC side, it is pretty much direct but it needs to match what the read/write format from the iXA4. The Automation1 Help section has some but I’m at a loss, also there were no examples or videos provided.

Summary: understanding when servo tuning is needed
Description: Hello Aerotech support, This question is not so much about a current problem so much as understanding what I think was the resolution of an existing one. See the attached picture for an image of our motor setup. Recently, we did some minor work on this – we temporarily removed but then replaced the torque sensor and manipulandum from the top of the shaft, and moved this entire framework a little along a set of sliders on which it rests. And what I noticed after this work was that the motor was unusually loud and didn’t seem to be functioning quite as well as usual – for example, in the position feedback values I was seeing greater than usual oscillations when the motor was dwelling at a particular position. At this point, I tried running the EasyTune step. The motor was still loud during the tuning, but after that finished, and I saved the parameters, the motor appeared to return to its normal volume and performance. So, following this, I have a two questions: (1) I don’t know if it’s possible to say without seeing this motor in person, but is there any basis to speculate why this incident happened? This would help me predict when such retuning might be needed again, and perhaps prevent the need to retune very often. (2) Did I take all the steps you would usually recommend to resolve this problem? Many thanks in advance for your time\\!

Summary: Motor seems unusually sensitive to small displacements
Description: Hello again – All is working fundamentally fine with the new tuning parameters we received here, but some other questions/issues have come up that might be related to tuning in general. So if it's OK to proceed in this ticket, here are the questions/issues: (1) Our lab's PI has the impression that the motor seems unusually sensitive to small displacements – like he was surprised by the strength of the motor's reaction, in terms of audible noise and measured current, when the manipulandum on top of it is lightly touched. This is observed with a variety of tuning parameters – not just the new ones generated here, but with those restored if I reload old .mcd files associated with earlier EasyTune runs. It also happens if we remove the cradle that was previously discussed here. So I am relaying the question of whether/how one might adjust the parameters if an observation like this is considered to be a problem. And I might also ask whether this behavior on the part of the motor seems normal. (2) Issue (1) came to our attention because we have been having issues with substantial electrical noise when trying to record EMG data when a monkey subject's arm is resting on the manipulandum. The noise seems to be very clearly related to the motor, and occurs in bursts when the motor is subjected to even tiny displacements. We've been having trouble sleuthing out the source of this noise, or finding an easy solution for it. We've confirmed that the motor is grounded and haven't had any success from connecting various components on/around the motor to ground. The noise dissipates as the electrodes are moved farther away from the motor, or if they are suspended above the motor but shielded by an intervening sheet of aluminum foil. So I think (1) was brought up in the context of wondering if this was at all contributing to our electrical noise problem. Beyond that, though, I welcome any other ideas for addressing this issue, and would be happy to do any other kind of data gathering that might be helpful (although I realize this issue is very specific to our application and perhaps beyond the scope of the support that may be offered here). I am attaching two videos that illustrate the above. In the sensitivityillustration.mp4 video, a segment of the video shows the trace that reflects the motor's current (scaled by .632 x 10, = roughly estimated torque in Nm x 10. Tick marks in the plot range from 5 to 5). During the video I am lightly tapping on the manipulandum. In the noise illustration.mp4 video, there is a mock EMG setup (an electrode pair is attached to a resistor). The screen shows both the estimated torque trace from before, and at bottom, the trace from the electrode pair (and the sound is from speakers reflecting that mock EMG recording). Many thanks in advance, again, for any time and insights. t looks like I forgot to attach the videos. They are attached here. Also note that EMG recordings have been conducted in proximity with Aerotech motors like this one before https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/systemsneuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2013.00098/full#h3\ https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/systems-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2013.00098/full#h3 So this should be, in theory, doable. noiseillustration.mp4\ https://support.aerotech.com/secure/attachment/234629/234629noiseillustration.mp4 sensitivityillustration.mp4\ https://support.aerotech.com/secure/attachment/234630/234630sensitivity_illustration.mp4 Karin Cox
