Summary: KLA (Singapore) Pte Ltd \ 7308_63832811 very noisy new stage
Description: Hi Adrian, We received a new stage 7308_63832811 which I found out is very noisy I have never seen before(from the result file). I know it passed monster result, but this is so abnormally noisy stage I don’t think Aerotech will treat this as normal stage. Please help to feedback AT US team with this concern. We need AT to review the result file again and clarify why the abnormal result and advise any comment. The stage is on hold now for install to system, pending AT answer. !image002.png\ thumbnail! !image004.png\ thumbnail!

Summary: KLA (Singapore) Pte Ltd \ XR3 stage tuning filter no limit
Description: Hi Adrian, Recently our MFG folk found out the filter number is run out (1 lowpass, 7 notch) during stage tuning, especially for few stages are really tough to tune. Question is, can we use more 7 notch filters for stage tuning? Does AT have any advice for this when we run out of filters? One issue we have seen now is when use more than 7, the monster/LT parser will pop up error therefor we can’t see the tuning result.

Summary: Axis Tuning
Description: Hello, we use an NDriveCP with the A3200 Software to measure samples. We have two problems right now: # We wanted to adjust the axles using EasyTune, but we can't change the travelDistance. The arrow keys do not work and entered values are automatically set to 0. So we can't start Easytune. what could be the reason? # When measuring, we notice that the axis starts to oscillate during acceleration and braking, which is visible on the measurements in the form of waves. On other systems we were able to reduce the jerk, which parameter do we have to adjust on the A3200 to reduce the vibration behavior? Many thanks for your help\\!

Summary: Request for Guidance on Parameter Compatibility and Gantry Tuning
Description: Dear Aerotech Support Team, I hope this message finds you well. Following the issues encountered with Omega#107 (GTSE48315), we would like to seek your guidance on two key topics: # Common File Compatibility We experienced an issue when applying the .prma file from Machine #17 to Machine #5, which resulted in the failure to activate Dock0_2. Therefore, we would like to understand: Which parameters can be commonly shared across machines (common parameters)? Which parameters must be machinespecific? In addition to .prma , we would appreciate your recommendations regarding other related files such as .cal and any configuration tied to the XC4 controller (Serial Number). 2. Gantry Tuning Machine #107 has undergone several tuning attempts, including adjustments to Home Offset, Loop Transmission, Fourier Transform, and Gain & Margin. Unfortunately, these efforts have not resolved the issue. We are seeking a practical and reliable tuning method, along with: Clear procedures for implementation Verification methods to ensure the machine operates accurately and stably Given that Aerotech equipment is now widely used across our Omega machines—and will continue to expand—we aim to streamline both operation and maintenance. Therefore, we would like to know: Are there recommended practices to maximize parameter and tuning compatibility across machines? How should we manage configuration files to ensure consistency and avoid conflicts? We would greatly appreciate your advice in helping us establish a standardized approach that supports both current operations and future scalability. Thank you very much for your continued support.

Summary: Inquiry Regarding Position Error Fault in A3200
Description: Dear Aerotech Technical Support, I hope you are doing well. We have observed that with an acceleration setting of 5000, a Position Error Fault occurred during operation. Although this issue has been resolved by switching from the "63200911 Loaded.prma" file to the "63200911 Loaded.prma tuning 20240709.prma" file, I would like to understand the root cause of this issue and how to prevent it from occurring in the future. h3. Observation: During testing with acceleration set to 5000, the "63200911 Loaded.prma" file triggered a Position Error Fault. However, when using the "63200911 Loaded.prma tuning 20240709.prma" file, we did not encounter any issues. Additionally, I have collected the following information to assist in troubleshooting: # An image showing the Position Fault Error in the A3200 Motion Composer. # A comparison of the Aerotech parameters to identify any differences. # A scope image from the A3200 during the occurrence of the position fault with acceleration set to 5000. Could you kindly provide insights into the meaning of the Position Error Fault, its root cause, and preventive steps to avoid similar issues in the future? Thank you for your support. I look forward to your response. Sincerely, Jongruk R.

In the training, it always started above 180 degrees, then eventually crossed 180 at a high frequency. For both X&Y, the phase starts below 180, crosses above 180 at a low frequency, then eventually crosses back down. When I monitored the position error during motion, X & Y had very low and practically equivalent errors. Is noise on the X axis expected, or is it indicating there is an underlying problem? Frequency response graphs are attached.

Summary: Stages making noise after upgrade
Description: Hi, We have an issue with an Aerotech 2axis system we currently have. This system was a purchase from about 10 years ago and has been sitting in our New Zealand office in the past years. The quote and drawings are attached below. We ordered a control update last year and just started upgrading the controls and software. We've been using this system a lot recently and it was running fine before the upgrade. After the upgrade, both the inner and outer axes make noises when a motion is initiated. Please see the attached videos. We did not touch the stages during the update, so there shouldn't be any physical rubbing present. Can you please help with identifying the root cause of the noises?

Summary: High Frequency Noise
Description: Hi Aerotech, I am a graduate student at the University of Maryland’s physics department. We are currently trying to integrate our highspeed linear stage ANT95L050 with our current scatteringtype SNOM, which involves using the stage as one arm of a Michaelsoninterferometer. In practice, this means cycling the stage a specified distance back and forth around a fixed point. I’ve included the basic code I use to achieve the oscillations. When I run the code, the stage makes a rather loud beeping sound the entire time (I’ve included an audio file). I know the stage is oscillating at the correct frequency and amplitude by checking the interferometer’s optical signal, I just want to check if this noise is normal for this kind of operation? And if so, do you have any recommendations on some kind of damping method to minimize the noise?

Description: Hello Derry, My name is Luke Hardy and I am a new engineer working with Jack Disciacca and Brian Peer at Coherent. I was wondering if you would help us with tuning our rotation stage. Currently we adjust the GainKp anytime the rotation stage is not working properly, but it looks like we are just increasing it over the course of a year. I wanted to know if there is a standard procedure or any guide for tuning the ServoLoop Gains? Rotation Stage: PN: ABRX150E1TAS SN: 348960-01 Software: A3200 Motion Composer (6.04.006) Thank you, Luke Hardy Hi Luke, Optimally tuning your stage does have some standard procedures. The best route to get this done is to speak with the service team who routinely work with customers on this specific task. I have cc'd them here, we will create a ticket to track the support case, which will also be the means of communication for the support. Service, can you please assist Luke with his controller tuning problem? Please ensure to include me on the issue. Luke, is there anything odd about the payload that you are moving with the stage? Is it a consistent mass and inertia during the operations? I believe I know the application, the payload from my recollection is a wafer on a chuck. If the mass changes during the process, optimal tuning for one mass may not be optimal for the other mass and we will need to take this into account. Are there any external forces on the payload during the motion or any other discontinuities that would change the payload mass inertia or forces felt during the laser operation? Can you please find the sales order number or numbers of the drive and stage for this system, we will need it to pull up the documentation we created when it shipped. Derry Crymble

Summary: Problem tuning an Axis
Description: Hi there. I hope you guys are all doing okay. I have a question on tuning an axis on the XR3 that does not work anymore. I almost had everything set up until there was a realization that I needed to scale the axis’ encoders so that we can fire the PSO’s at very small distances. We need to fire them 15nm apart. This was done with the NPAQ using an encoder multiplier of x8000 and setting the Unit count to 2000000. This is very high compared to the defaults of x1 and 250 units. So, after setting this up and trying to avoid running the stage at 8000x speeds that can cause significant damages, I got it right. But the tuning was now completely off with strong oscillations and noise from the stage. Running Easy Tune then failed, it kept saying the encoder signal had minimal current. I am unsure what I did, but eventually I got it to work. The encoder signals are lined perfectly up on the circle in encoder tuning, so it should work. I think I committed the new values once in there, even if they were almost identical to the old ones, and then it was able to run past the first step in Easy Tune. However it will always fail after it tries motion on the different frequencies and saying its trying to go back to start. This is the error: !image001.png\ thumbnail! “The calling thread does not have access to this service”. This error makes no sense. I run Automation 1 studio as Administrator as well to make sure it has all access. I just rebooted the PC and restarted the XR3. Always the same error. Can someone please assist on this error? I am unable to tune manually, as the parameters before setting the multiplier are unstable, and the PID parameters I have from the NPAQ are completely different. As far as I know, this error came after I set the encoder multiplier up, and it worked before I did that. Best Regards, Ronny Pettersen Production Engineer ASN Norway AS

Summary: Operating without Halls(Using Commutation Search was unsuccessful) and Position Error Fault & Over Current Fault
Description: Operating without Halls: Using Commutation Search was unsuccessful I configured the driver and noneHall linear motor according to the guide, and then do the checklist items one by one. Then , I use the noneHall phase search method (Commutation Search) and set the corresponding parameters according to Aerotech's help manual and technical support articles. Attached is a screenshot of the source. This is one of the website addresses—Operating without Halls: AutoMSET and Commutation Search Aerotech Knowledge Base Aerotech Knowledge Base\ https://knowledgebase.aerotech.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=10393057 Afterwards, the Motor Phasing module was started, but the phase finding process was not fully completed. Finally — The motor moves in a stepped manner 6 to 10 times, then stops and reports a prompt. it reported "Hall Sequence must contain exactly six distinct Hall States". But operating without Halls, why does the software give me hall related prompts, and how can I solve this problem. Afterwards, EasyTune was done, and the same situation was found when Motor Phasing was completed after tuning. h1. Position Error Fault & Over Current Fault After EasyTune, it can execute single command instructions and simple instruction codes, but it will report a Position Error Fault or Over Current Fault fault. Attached screenshot, According to the data graph, the CurrCmd gradually increases after the motor starts, and the CurFbk follows it. After reaching the MaxCurrentClamp value, the motor decelerates and stop. After increasing MaxCurrentClamp to the default value, the results were similar. I have referred to the suggestions in the link (Position Error & Over Current on "Test As System"(TAS) Systems Aerotech Knowledge Base - Aerotech Knowledge Base\ https://knowledgebase.aerotech.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=3212012 ) to conduct a preliminary check of the system. Is this phenomenon caused by Motor Phasing error? If not, how should I solve it

Summary: Automation1 Encoder Signals from Aux Port - noise issue
Description: Hi, I’m integrating an iXC2e drive to replicate the function of the EPAQMR it’s replacing. The Auxiliary output port specification appears to be the same differential RS422 AB Encoder Signals as the EPAQMR. The pinout is different. To account for the different pinout, I have cut the Aerotech supplied molded db9 from the cable and installed a regular DB9 connector (rs# 7659432) and connected pins 2>2, 3>7, 4>1, & 9>6. I lifted that pinout from Table 34 of the iXC2e manual and mapped the new pins to match Table 222 from the EPAQ-MR manual. This reconfigured DB9 connects to an external module. We’re experiencing enough noise on the encoder signal that it’s causing the resolved position to drift when the stage is stationary, making it unusable for the application. Can you advise if there are any configuration options that could be influencing the signals. On the new end I have soldered the cable shield to the shell of the db9 which helped a little. I need to figure out if I need a special cable manufactured and what properties might need to be specified for this. Kind Regards, Brian

Summary: Position Error Fault when setting gear mode
Description: hi We have been driving the motors by sending voltage waveforms. The protocol is basically, first to set the gear mode to 1, then send voltage waveforms from NIDAQ, to finish set the gear mode back to 0. All steps are done in Matlab. The same protocol could work well on both ADRT150135(628831A11) and ADRT260160(630431A11). But recently the same protocol didn't work on ADRT150135 ONLY and resulted in a Position Error Fault when setting gear mode to 1. The ADRT150135 motor was observed doing crazy rotation at uncontrolled high speed a few times. Please help to locate and fix the issue. Thank you very much. Best Yanting

Summary: Stage tuning issue
Description: Good Afternoon, We are having some issues with one of the Aerotech stages we installed on a machine towards the back end of last year which we believe might be related to the tuning. We had the stages tuned by Aerotech to meet a specification set by the customer and unfortunately overtime it seems that we are no longer meeting this requirement, and we would like to try and understand why. When we select an exit velocity of 25mm/s (maximum) we can’t achieve a scenario where we have the velocity feedback, position error and position delta within the allowable tolerance (max position error = +/-0.01, max pos delta = 0.2mm). We’ve tested the max/min balance pressure without going out of the ‘neutral balance’ and there wasn’t a significant improvement. I will be visiting the customers site on Monday and am wondering if anyone would be available from Aerotech to provide technical support? Clive is knowledgeable of our application.

Summary: Attempting to tune a counterbalanced vertical linear stage
Description: Good evening Support, We are putting together a new system, with a stacked X/Y stage, and an Aerotech AGVXPO scan head riding on a linear motor Z stage, The SO# is 637477. The stage we are using for Z is a small linear motor stage from Primatics, the PXL43025 (see attached spec sheet). We have that setup using counterbalance springs, so when unpowered it sits at the mechanical equilibrium close to the center of travel. The limited travel range (~20mm) was preventing me from executing the automated motor phasing operation, but I was able to confirm the commutation offset and direction using manual commands (via the process described in the help files using TuningSetMotorAngle). I have been making progress with tuning the stage but am struggling with a sharp high frequency resonance close to 2.0kHz that I am unable to remove. This resonance causes Easy Tune to fail, and generates an OverCurrentFault toward the end of executing a Frequency Response. I’ve attached a recent frequency response with screenshot, plus the current MCD file. Can you help to identify options that might be available for reducing this resonance, so I can get this stage under control?

Summary: CCS130DR160WCUT-TAC Emitting Smoke While Tuning
Description: Whenever we tune our CCS130DR160WCUTTAC rotary (SN: 27351603), the rotary will overheat and start smoking. The electrical connections to the rotary and its surrounding voltages were measured, and everything was found to be connected correctly. This is the second CCS130DR that we have experienced smoking with; the smoking of the previous CCS130DR was a reaction of the overcurrent going through the encoder, making it difficult to manually spin the rotary when the axis was disabled (where we would expect the rotary to move freely, instead). After our current CCS130DR started smoking, it is also becoming difficult to rotate the rotary when the axis was disabled. Attached is the .mcd file. It was on Aerotech Automation1 version 2.8.1.

I have been running the stage without anything on top of it just fine by loading the "63917111 No Load" MCD file. However, I recently put a bit of load on the stage (15 kg) and when I did, the stage started vibrating. I don't know if it was hunting for its nominal position but it was very noticeable. I then figured I would try to run the stage with the "63917111 Loaded" MCD to account for the additional load. After loading the file, I tried to enable the axis and heard a load noise from the stage which was accompanied with an "overcurrent" fault. I checked some of the settings, everything seemed fine. I tried to clear the error and enable the axis again and the same thing happened. I am hesitant to continue playing around with this because I don't want to damage the stage, but I am at a loss for what is going on. Any ideas? The load of 15 kg I currently have on the stage is well within the specified maximum load. Thoughts on what is happening? Any help you can provide would be much appreciated.

The velocity command threshold is set to 88 mm/s for both axes, which is nowhere close to 47. In addition, in both cases it occurred in the middle of the movement, not when turning around. Moves like these occur all throughout the 9 hour toolpath with no issue. Can you help me prevent this error from occurring in the future?

During incoming inspection, we've noticed a loud siren sound when it was running at 350rpm with a Rockwell drive, and we confirmed the same noise when tested with the Aerotech drive. I've attached the video recorded by GTSE after the repair. I didn't pick up the siren noise initially, so I had approved the shipment of the reworked stage. You can hear the siren noise in the video, and it was louder in person. We don't think this siren sound is normal, and we cannot ship this stage to our customer in its current condition. Have you ever noticed any of the stages making a noise like this? Do you know what might be causing it? Thanks.

Summary: Loud screeching noise when homing X and Y axis (Aerotech A3200)
Description: Hello, My name is David Girard. I am working under the supervision of Dr. Arnaud Weck. We have noticed an issue lately when using our Aerotech system. When we home the X or Y axis, a loud screeching noise is produced. When homing the X axis, the noise is quieter, but the system still manages to home the axis. When we are homing the Y axis, the noise is very loud, and the homing does not complete. An “Overcurrent Fault” appears on the X axis, and when we try to reactivate the X axis, the screeching noise continues until another overcurrent fault occurs. To stop this, we need to deactivate the Y axis and set it manually to the center. Here is some useful information about our system: Controller: Npaq X stage: ANT 130XY Z stage: ANT 130V The configuration file is attached to this email. We have tried the following things: Reduce the homing speed from 20 mm/s to 10 mm/s Perform EasyTune Restart the controller Remove anything on the stage Let us know what you think might be the issue. We can also send more information if you need. Best regards, David

Summary: Changing The Ramp Rate Has Limited Effect On Acceleration
Description: Changing The Ramp Rate Has Limited Effect On Acceleration And Not Sure How To Use API To Check If Homed # Application: XR3 controller with XSL3-10 amplifiers drives custom gimbal system. Requesting assistance with resolving several issues: The system’s acceleration appears to be clamped at 10 degrees / sec^2. The motor reaches the desired velocity slower than necessary. Increasing the ramp rate, after a certain point, does not affect the acceleration. Changes to the axis speed did not affect the acceleration either. Is there some other parameter that could be affecting the acceleration besides the ramp rate? Is there a way to read back the current ramp rate using the API? The goal is to confirm that the ramp rate that we set the motion controller to is being used. 2. I am aware that there is a homed property in the A3200 API. However, it is unclear to me how to retrieve it and use it. Could you provide some clarification on that?

Summary: OverCurrent fault on screw-driven goniometer
Description: We have a two-axis (AZ and EL) system. When enabled, our EL stage no longer moves more than 0.07 deg incrementally before giving an OverCurrent fault with a short rattle sound and vibration that seems to come from the brake assembly. We can still hear the clicking of the brake as it engages and disengages, which is what we observed during normal operation. We checked for physical obstructions and did not find any. We cycled power to all components, and this did not fix the issue. We manually disabled the brake (DriveBrakeOff), and we found that we could rotate the screw of the disabled stage by hand once we did that. There was a facility power outage between when we last ran the system as normal and now, and perhaps this was the cause of some issues. I attached a CSV file with position/current command/feedback for AZ and EL for one of the runs. Can you please advise on troubleshooting that we can perform? Thank you, Shea Charkowsky

Summary: PRO165SL600TT1LI1CP1PL0TAC screw resonance
Description: Hello, I am tuning the servo motor on the PRO165SL600 stage that we recently purchased. I am experiencing screw resonance issues that prevent me from achieving the same servo positioning performance that we have on our PRO165SL400 unit. When the servo gains that work well on the 400mm unit are used on the 600mm unit, a high frequency instability occurs. That instability appears to be related to the screw and quickly disappears if the screw is damped by touching it. Do you have any options for reducing the tendency of the screw to resonate and cause servo instability? I can not see the coupling between the motor and the ballscrew as it is hidden inside a housing with only a small slot to access the attachment screw. Is there possibly an upgraded coupling that would have higher stiffness and could that possibly help? Any other suggestions would be appreciated. The serial number of our unit is: 50713801 and the model number is: PRO165SL600TT1LI1CP1PL0TAC in case you need that.

Summary: Rotary making noise when spinning at higher speeds
Description: HelloI couldn’t find the serial #, but can provide more information if requested. I noticed the rotary began making noise after we’d been cutting parts for a while. The noise is sometimes a loose turning sound (video4), and sometimes it is a loud grinding sound (video3). In both videos, the rotary is rotating at 15deg/sec for 360 deg. In video 3, the equipment is running a program; video 4 its following a motion command. The noise only occurs as you start rotating at higher speeds (5 deg/sec+). We’re cutting .5161.27mm diameter tubes, irregularly. When I do cut parts, its usually about 300400 tubes cut. We’ve had the equipment in since about last May (it was sitting used at a low freq in our customers warehouse 1-2yrs before it arrived to us). This problem began last Friday 3/14/25; since then, we’ve disassembled the chuck to take a look at the rotary housing. However, we stopped there as we don’t want to cause unintended damage. Are there any suggestions for next steps that we can take? We were also going based off the attached manual, which was provided to us from our customer, but we noticed that the model in the manual is incorrect/different from what we actually have in the equipment.

Summary: Velocity Error Faults on Axis A (ILT Serial # 8718)
Description: Hello Aerotech Team I have a customer that has a rotational axis model AGR50M1ML25LI1T and they are having velocity and position errors. The axis was changed back in early 2024 and was not having any issues with it until two weeks ago. When they changed the axis, they did not run any tuning programs. They used the same parameter file settings they already had. Now they are trying to run the EasyTune application but it cannot be completed due to the velocity and position errors. The email chain also has some more information such as graphs of the axis movement comparison between the A axis and a good axis (B). This is part of the response from the customer (Yellow Highlighted) when I suggested to run the EasyTune application according to the instructions attached in this email. We have attempted to run the Easy Tune tool on axis A but we experience the same velocity error fault during the calibration motion. This occurs at the default settings as well as the recommended settings of 20degrees @ 1/10th speed. We have also attempted to run the Easy Tune at a varying speeds and distances; however, we still experience the same velocity error fault. In addition, I have tried to manually adjust the gain values to maybe get the velocity error to go away long enough for us to run the Easy Tune tool with no success. The last thing we tried was to attempt disable the velocity error by using the A3200 Configuration Manager to set the velocity error threshold to 0 as indicated in the manual. We did this in hopes of allowing us to run the Easy Tune tool without faulting out during the calibration motions, however we still experienced the velocity error fault. I have attached two more digital scope plots to this email for your team’s Investigation. The plots are of the faulty axis A and of the known working axis B. These plots show the position, velocity, acceleration, and current data through 360degree rotation. Axis A did not experience a velocity error fault during this plot and as mentioned in a previous email, we only experience this fault when we are jogging in increments from rest and not when we are making large sweeps of continuous motion. I am curious to know if your team believes that our issues could be due to mechanical degradation in the gearbox/motor. If so, what could have caused it to wear out so soon with such little use whilst also being located in a clean room environment? We have an identical unit in the same room and configuration that has not experienced these issues. Do you believe running the Easy Tune will resolve our issues without needing to replace the whole drive unit? Do you have any tips on getting it to work without triggering the velocity error fault? Please let us know if what your and your team think of the provided results as well as any additional feedback you may have. !image.png\ thumbnail!

Please see the below answers/notes to the feedback provided. When did this problem start to occur? Was it immediately after we changed the axis in early 2024? This issue is a recent one. After replacement of the axis in early 2024, 67 full shop orders were run without issue to verify functionality. This velocity error issue arose around 2 weeks ago during testing and the last active shop order where we utilized this axis was in August 2024. Is this axis in a harsh environment that would accelerate any wear? This machine is located within a clean room environment which rules out any concerns with dust or debris getting into the drive mechanism. In addition, this axis has not seen much use since its installation. As stated above, this drive ran about 67 full shop orders after replacement and the last active shop order was in August. Please make sure the cut is not affecting any of the wires inside that cable. Upon closer inspection of the motor cables, it seems like the damage is to the insulation only and none of the conductors have been damaged.

We have utilized the digital scope program to plot the behavior of the servo motor up to the fault and I have attached the Scope Files to this email for your reference. These graphs were generated using an incremental step of 15 degrees and we have configured the conditional plot logic to change the color of the graph to turquoise when we experience a fault. The file name indicates the number of points, period, and fault position. The graph for 360 degree rotation on Axis A utilized an incremental step for 360 degrees to capture the motor’s behavior when we are moving in a continuous motion. Looking at the graphs of Axis A compared to Axis B, it seems like we are observing a high amount of position and velocity error in the beginning of each incremental step with a large amount of initial overshoot with little to no stabilization over the duration of the step. This leads me to believe we have some sort of tuning error or mechanical friction. Please see the below snippets of the graphs with my observations. (PLOT 1) Axis A: Incremental Jog by 15 degrees. Fault at position of 30 degrees. Here we have a large initial positional error and velocity error during transient response. As the velocity ramps up quickly, we are overshooting the command setpoint which gives us a velocity error in the positive direction. It looks like the drive then tries to drop the velocity to bring us back down closer to the command velocity where we overshoot the negative correction as we approach what would usually be the steady state response of the step. During the steady state response of the step, it seems like we are oscillating heavily when compared to Axis B which is analyzed below. !image003.png\ thumbnail! (PLOT 6) Axis B: Incremental Jog by 15 degrees. No fault Here we have the usual spike of initial error as we begin ramping up to speed and cresting to our command velocity. What we can observe in this graph is that the initial peak of velocity error on axis B is significantly lower at a peak of 3 deg/sec compared to our average peak of about 1215 deg/sec on axis A. In addition, the velocity feedback shows that our correction during steady state response is much smoother and consistent which indicates that we are not significantly over or undershooting the command setpoint during steady state response. !image004.png\ thumbnail! Looking at these graphs it would seem to me like the servo on axis A may need tuning. However, as stated in my previous email, the Gain values Kpos, Ki, Kp, Aff, Vff, and Kpi are identical in all 3 axis. This leads to the following questions: # Are the Gain values for Axis A, B and C standardized to specific setpoints? # Could the reoccurring errors we are experiencing be due to not tuning Axis A after the unit was replaced early 2024? # If the drive was tuned after replacement, would the need to adjust these tuning values indicate some sort of mechanical wear that would require higher/lower gain values to reach steady state with less over/undershoot? # Do you suggest we run EasyTune to get Axis A within tolerance? Would running EasyTune have any risks to bring our machine out of calibration or validation? # Do you have any other observations of the graphs that could illuminate our observed issues? Please let me know if there is anything I can provide for clarification or if you suggest any next steps for resolving our issues.

They did notice a small nick in the insulation of one of the cables to the drive, could this be the culprit? !image005.png\ thumbnail! Regarding attempting to move the axis by hand, we are not able to induce movement in the gearbox by hand for any of the axis’ due to the gearing being too high. This is true for axis A, B and C. The issue seems to be more prevalent on incremental movement from rest. When we jog the axis in continuous mode, we are not able to recreate the issue as reliably as when we are jogging at 1525 degrees at a time. We usually experience the error around a position of 6090 degrees as well as around 180 when we are jogging incrementally. Not sure if a nick in the cable insulation could cause this behavior. Please let us know what action items we should pursue next.

These errors occur both when we are running through a program in automatic mode and when we are jogging the axis manually via the HMI and it seems to occur when we are attempting to move the drive from a stopped state such as after an incremental jog or after we complete a weld routine and rotate our fixture 180 degrees. For what it’s worth, it seems that we are experiencing these faults around the 90degree and 180-degree positions, but this is not consistent and may be purely coincidence. We have attempted to utilize the Digital Scope tool to monitor the velocity, and current command/feedback graphs to try and capture these values when we experience a fault however we do not see any spike in velocity error, nor do we see a spike in position error above our set thresholds. To capture this data we are using conditional plot logic to stop the recording when we see a velocity or position error fault to attempt to capture the values leading up to the fault. I have also looked at the tuning values such as Kpos, Kp, Ki, etc. and have found the values to be identical across all 3 horizontal axis A, B, and C. Our fault thresholds for Velocity and Position are also identical across axis A, B, and C. Could we please get guidance as to where we should direct our focus to? Do you think it is an issue with our setpoints, configuration, tuning? Do you believe that this is caused by some mechanical wear and tear which is leading to resistance. Is there some other factor that we are missing that could be causing our repeated faults on axis A? Please let me know if there is anything else I can provide for further clarification. Thank You,

Summary: Hexapod instability
Description: Tech Support Please assist Mr Thomas Grainge with this instability issue on his new hexapod. Please add me to the case as a participant, too. Thomas, Thank you for your detailed description of the problem. The hexapod should be able to easily make submicron movements. It could potentially be a servo tuning issue. If we tested & tuned the hexapod with a much heavier mass than you have on it now, that could explain things. We'll see what tech support comes up with. Hopefully it is just a servo tuning issue.

It generally is working well but we have encountered a curious issue. When making very small movements, it seems as though there are positions where the hexapod is unstable it will constantly oscillate/vibrate/jitter until it is moved out of the unstable position. I specifically noticed this when we are moving in the Z axis by 1 micrometer increments. Occasionally I will reach one of these regions, and the hexapod appears to oscillate in X and Y, and possibly also Z. The amplitude of these oscillations seems to be 2 micrometers at most. As I continue to step forwards in Z by 1 micrometer steps, after moving 34 micrometers the oscillations stop and the hexapod becomes totally stable and still again. This behavior was easily detectable to us because we have optical fibers mounted to the stage with a visiblelight laser shining through them, and we can clearly see the motion of the stage through the flickering of the laser light. It's also visible in our microscope camera aimed at our attached tooling. We do have the hexapod mounted sideways (so that Y+ is towards the sky and the cables are coming out the top of the base), with our tooling attached (approximately 250300 grams). And we are of course operating below the minimum repeatability of the axes according to the provided testing documentation (2.3 and 2.9 micrometers for the X and Y axes, respectively). My initial guess about this behavior is that we are commanding the hexapod to move to a position that is between two steps in the strut motors, and it's changing constantly back and forth between steps. Another colleague of mine suggested possibly a PID controller calibration issue. Do you have any thoughts about what could cause this behavior and how we could mitigate it? Thanks, Thomas Grainge Photonics Lab Technician

Summary: Automation1 iXL5e Drive/Motor Tuning Troubleshooting
Description: Hello, We have been trying to tune our motors (attached specification(s): Wittestein RadHardMRSR064AMN50014448000 (004).pdf and Empire Magnetics MotorResolverWiringDiagram_OPGRevA.pdf). We are having difficulties tuning either motor with effectively “no load” (picture of setup: 20250416 Benchtest Setup.png). When we utilize the AutoTune utility, the parameters that are output by the process causes a severe oscillation and extremely audible noise in our setup. Default factory drive settings result in no oscillations or audible noise, but the motion runs in fits and starts and is overall not consistent or smooth enough for our application. “Classic” closedloop tuning would report a “quality level” of around 90%, but as soon as these parameters were accepted, saved, and the controller restarted, upon initial commutation, the system would destabilize as per above. Our system developer seems to think that the system is responding negatively to the presence of the two shaft couplers we have in the drivetrain. The couplers are zerobacklash, but allow for radial misalignment via damped spring/elastomer wafers. The presumption being that the harmonics of the system results in poor feedback for the automatic tuning utility to provide a good result. As an example (202504-16 Benchtest Parameter Example.png), the "Old Value" was the default motor parameters tuning. The classic tuning made perfect motion on the drive. As soon as we hit "Apply Changes" the drive immediately exhibits the severe behaviour mentioned above, even without resetting the controller. After a reset, the drive fails to commutate and the parameters need to be reset to factory default. Additional load on the drivetrain makes any automatic tuning method within Aerotech’s software fail. Given the information above, can we get some support on how best to tune our system?

Summary: Low Torque Overcurrent Fault
Description: Hi there, we’re having an issue where we keep getting overcurrent faults at a much lower torque than expected. We have a 10:1 gear box on motor. The overcurrent limit is set to 10 A (as received from the config file), but the drive is faulting at around 17 Nm. If I’m interpreting correctly - for the BM500, it has a 3.6 Nm stall torque at 12.4 A rms, so I’d think effective stall torque would be 36 Nm, and be able to hit closer to 30 Nm with a 10 A average current limit. Is there any configuration or something I can check to see why this is the case? We must be able to reach at least 22 Nm with this drive train… Thanks, Rebecca

Summary: understanding when servo tuning is needed
Description: Hello Aerotech support, This question is not so much about a current problem so much as understanding what I think was the resolution of an existing one. See the attached picture for an image of our motor setup. Recently, we did some minor work on this – we temporarily removed but then replaced the torque sensor and manipulandum from the top of the shaft, and moved this entire framework a little along a set of sliders on which it rests. And what I noticed after this work was that the motor was unusually loud and didn’t seem to be functioning quite as well as usual – for example, in the position feedback values I was seeing greater than usual oscillations when the motor was dwelling at a particular position. At this point, I tried running the EasyTune step. The motor was still loud during the tuning, but after that finished, and I saved the parameters, the motor appeared to return to its normal volume and performance. So, following this, I have a two questions: (1) I don’t know if it’s possible to say without seeing this motor in person, but is there any basis to speculate why this incident happened? This would help me predict when such retuning might be needed again, and perhaps prevent the need to retune very often. (2) Did I take all the steps you would usually recommend to resolve this problem? Many thanks in advance for your time\\!
