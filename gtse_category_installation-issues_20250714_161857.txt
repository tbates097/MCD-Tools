Summary: Urgent Request for Installation Support and Missing Components – XYZ Bio Printer (PO# P1283263)
Description: Dear Aerotech Technical Support, I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request your urgent assistance regarding the XYZ Bio Printer (PO# P1283263, SO# 643591 & 643592), which was recently delivered to the University of St. Thomas. While we have only received the core components of the system (specifically, the motion stages and controller as attached), we have encountered a critical issue: the equipment cannot be assembled or operated as a complete printer system in its current form. Most notably, the structural support or mounting frame required for the Zaxis stage installation and overall functionality appears to be missing. Prior to the purchase, I discussed this concern with Cameron Anderson, who kindly confirmed that although we would not be purchasing a granite base due to cost and weight concerns, the system could still be made operational with alternative support solutions. However, no such components or clear instructions were included with the shipment, nor have we been advised on how to proceed with setup. Given the cost ($54,000) of this equipment and its importance to my research, this is a pressing issue. Additionally, we have not yet received a response to our earlier messages, including my June 10th email and a followup from our university’s purchasing representative, Cathy Fasching (fasc4595@stthomas.edu). To move forward, we would greatly appreciate your support with the following: # Immediate guidance on how to complete the mechanical installation and safely operate the printer, including any CAD drawings, setup manuals, or mounting schematics that should have accompanied the equipment. # Clarification on whether any physical components (such as custom mounting frames or fixtures) were omitted and need to be provided. # Direct support (either virtual or inperson) for installation and verification of system functionality. # A technical point of contact who can support us with this issue. Given the total value of the system and the fact that a Production Service Configurator (ProdServiceTAS) was included in the order, we expected a plugandplay solution or, at minimum, complete instructions and all essential parts for safe and functional installation. Please confirm receipt of this message and advise on the next steps. Attached are the following: Purchase Order (P1283263.pdf) Sales Order Acknowledgement for Equipment (SO# 643591) Sales Order Acknowledgement for Warranty Extension (SO# 643592) Photos of delivered components Thank you very much for your attention to this matter.

This is the first time working with the XR3 and HyperWire. As you may know, we are trying to keep this compatible with the A3200 SW v6.04.002 that we have installed on all of our other systems. But as I read the install instructions for this, it looks like I need to first install the Automation1 – iSMCSetup.exe to configure and control the XR3 and load the HyperWire driver. Is this correct? I thought we were supposed to be compatible with the A3200 SW. Please advise. I feel a bit lost and I’m still trying to locate the SW that accompanied this system. I will need an MCD file and probably a Cal file for this system. Jay Jay Gregerson Principal Engineer Collins Aerospace 27300 SW Parkway Ave. Wilsonville, OR 97070

However, we do have a C26263 cable that says “From: XR3 HOUT Channel X TO: GL4” as shown in the picture “C26263_1” attached. I can’t find “HOUT” from the XR3, so I am assuming that this cable is to be connected from the XR3 “HSOUT”, but I am not sure which of the 5 identical but separate connectors on the other end should be connected to. I am assuming that some of them should be connected to the “ENCODER INPUT” on the GL4, but which of the 5 connectors should I use? I also noticed that the older Aerotech CLS has ground for the encoder connections as shown in the picture “Aerotech CLS Galvo 3”, but the new connectors for GL4 seems to lack the ground. I am guessing it is just the new design. # We have the old Aerotech Transformer Module running out current Galvo as shown in picture “Aerotech Transformer Module Galvo”. Can I use this to power the Control Supply and Motor Supply of the GL4? I am assuming the connections are the same as the old system with Aerotech CLS. If you could provide the answers for these questions, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Stephen

Summary: Request help with wiring and setup of ACT stage
Description: Hello, We recently purchased an ACT stage and received it, however, given the high voltage and our lack of expertise in electrical setup, it appears complex. I was wondering if we could set up a video Teams call asap for Aerotech to walk us through the wiring and setup to be safe. If not successful, we are happy to have a technician visit our site to set it up. Thank you, Kavin Hi Derry, How can we schedule for an Aerotech technician to visit and set the system up until it is ready to use? The wiring appears confusing and the manuals are confusing given that we are not experts in mechatronics.

Summary: Control Software Setup Questions
Description: Hello, I am currently setting up the linear stage (PRO190LM & Automation1iXC4e10EB0MX2PSO1SX0 Controller) recently sent to Tom Oliver’s group at the University of Bristol. I had a couple of questions about the control software. # We were sent two .mcd files, unloaded and loaded, are these specific to our setup? Is there any calibration process that we should run first, or will these work well as is? # Also regarding the .mcd files, we will be using the LabView API to control the stage, are the .mcd files loaded onto the controller by the automation1 software? i.e. if there’s no LabView command to read the .mcd file, will it use the last one uploaded by the automation1 software? # Currently if the stage is asked to move to a position beyond its limits, it will throw an error and prevent any subsequent moves until the error is acknowledged. Preferably the stage would not execute this move and just run the next one. My current plan would be to add a case in the LabView software that recognises this error and clears it to allow for the next move. Is this the best way of doing this, or can/should this fault behaviour be changed in the .mcd files? Any help that you can provide on these points would be greatly appreciated. Many Thanks, Jacob

Hi Micheal, Thank you for your message. Unfortunately, we may not have availability this week—would it be possible to schedule the meeting early next week instead? In the meantime, we've had an initial discussion with Aerotech's support staff regarding the motor drivers. They mentioned that the motor drivers could only have a single set of PID parameters configured. Given the gravitational effects on our vertically moving platform, the system's dynamic model parameters vary significantly between upward and downward movements. According to Aerotech, this could potentially result in overcurrent issues, affecting the continuous completion of upward and downward cycles. We would like to confirm with you whether this issue could indeed occur, and if possible, discuss this problem during our meeting next week. Thank you for your understanding and assistance. Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Ying, Thanks for reaching out, glad to hear this build is moving forward. Yes these drives will need to be housed in the an electrical control cabinet. Aerotech recommends an IP54 (or higher) cabinet, as specified here. Mechanical Specifications \ https://help.aerotech.com/automation1/hardwaremanuals/Automation1iXC6eandXC6web/Chapter1Introduction/Mechanical-Specifications.htm Before deciding on an enclosure size you will want to finalise your electrical design eg, 3phase distribution, transformers, safety interlocks and overload relays. When I last discussed this project, the plan was to install the motor supply directly to 400VAC 3phase Mains, removing the need for a transformer. That being said you may want to provision for space in the cabinet for a suitable step up transformer, as these drives are rated for 480VAC. Perhaps we could have a call later this week to discuss this as well as any other installation questions you might have.

Please find attached the order information for your reference. Additionally, after the electricians inspected the drivers, they advised that the entire setup should be enclosed for safety.

Summary: Motor Installation Advice for AGR75
Description: Hi All, Please see below question from Frank Darmann @ ANSTO. Hi Michael, We have received the first AGR75 rotation stage with integrated incremental encoder to prototype. As you may remember Aerotek did not offer this version with a stepper motor. So we said we would make an adaptor plate to our stepper motors and install. My first approach was to remove this flange plate as shown below to expose the worm drive shaft and the provided coupling so our motor shaft can fit to the coupling. I have taken off the four fasteners hoping this plate would come off however it does not. Can you please ask for advice what is the best way I can adapt a stepper motor with a shaft to the coupling presented. Cheers Frank

Michael was a wealth of knowledge and has the system tuned to what we believe is optimal performance. I'm certain we would not have been able to do as well on our own. In addition, he took the time to share some of his extensive technical knowledge with my team and we are more educated on optimizing and troubleshooting our system. We'll be better prepared to make adjustments in the future because he was here. He really did an exceptional job and I wanted to recognize his efforts.

Summary: New ADRT Installation
Description: Hi Joe, I have installed the new motor that we purchased from you. I am having issues tuning the motor into our application. I first tried the auto tune process with its default values of 10 deg and 1deg/sec. The process failed all the time for an over current error. I then tried to use the Autotune process where I varied the amplitude value and the Freq value to see if I could get gains that were suitable. I did manage to get gains that the system deemed OK at a value of 75% OK. I installed the gains at 75%, but this did not make any difference. I have looked through all the help details supplied with the Soloist software but cannot see anything else That could help. It would be greatly appreciated if you could supply me with some assistance in this matter. Thanks.

Summary: New ADRT Install issue
Description: Hi Joe, Clive, Still having issues tuning this motor. I did manage to get a quality estimate of 94%, see attached photograph. I then proceeded to run easy tune facility. The default settings for EasyTune are : travel distance 10 deg and speed 1 deg/s I ran this selection to verify that everything is OK. I require the speed in my application to be 20 deg/second, so I set the speed to 20 and started the distance at 10 and set the Performance target to 2, as my load will vary in the application. I then incremented the distance by 1, running EasyTune each time. It wasn’t until a few iterations later when I reached a distance of 19 and the EasyTune failed during the identify axis part of the EasyTune process. One thing I found is that I cannot home the unit. The home position is set to 0.69999 deg. If I position the ADRT at 5 deg and try and home it, it will go to approximately to 0 deg, but then fails for an over current failure. I also cannot get the ADRT to travel more than 30 deg without failing an over current failure. I have also attached the latest parameter file from the controller . Any other assistance would be appreciated.

Summary: Automation1 Transformation Setup at 90 degrees
Description: Hello, I am currently working on an application on a system where I need to perform a transformed motion path with the laser coming in at a 90degree angle. The motion setup consists of a stacked XY, the weld head mounted on a Z axis, a rotary Baxis for tilting the weld head, and a rotary A-axis facing vertical which spins the part. As mentioned above, the B axis is at 90 degrees. Attached is my aeroscript program that I am using to execute the motion path, but it does not appear to be moving the correct axes. I would expect X to move, but instead Z is moving, as if the head is pointing straight down onto the part. Could you please assist in making sure I have all of the right commands in order to execute this motion path successfully? I appreciate any help you guys can provide. Grant

Summary: Requesting assistance on wiring the NMARK properly
Description: Hello Aerotech, We are currently trying to reinstall the NMARK CLS as part of reassembling the repaired laser system, however, due to personnel changes information on the NMARKs proper wiring was lost. Would you be able to provide us assistance on wiring the NMARK properly? We have tried wiring the ax1 and ax2 cabling in multiple different ways (see "AX1 axis wiring with" and "AX2 axis wiring" images) and in all cases A3200 displays an amplifier fault (see A3200 amplifier fault image). The wiring in those images is for the cable leading from the NMARK to the NPAQ (see NMARK Cable 15 images for information on the cable). I have also attached image of the NMARK indicator lights showing that power is properly being supplied but there is still a status error. Attached are also images of the front wiring of the NMARK as well as the NMARK overall. Would you be able to help us resolve this wiring issue? Best, John Tatka

Summary: Single axis system setup
Description: Hi Jeff, I admit, this is beyond my level programming experience. I've CC'd our Global Technical Support team on this message. One of their product support engineers will be in touch to help. GTS, Jeff is trying to set up a single axis system to be geared to an encoder signal via the Auxiliary feedback input. Prior to his use of Automation1 he was able to do this in Soloist via the clock and direction functions. I believe this can be managed on the new controller via Gearing functions and FeedbackSetup Parameters. Can you assist Jeff with this implementation? His SO # is 640247.

I am trying to set up gearing the axis to the auxiliary feedback input. I can set the ratio with GearingSetRatio(X, 1.0) and I can turn gearing on with GearingOn(X, GearingFilter.Filtered). The problem is in associating the input from the auxiliary feedback input to the gearing for the X axis. The function GearingSetLeaderAxis() is the only place I can find that takes a GearingSource, but it also requires another axis as the leaderAxis.

Summary: Wiring New Motor with Break Option into Existing Assembly
Description: Hello. We recently ordered a new motor that has the break option to replace a motor (without the break option) in our assembly. However, this means that the cable we are using does not have the correct wiring. We are willing to rewire the cable but would like advice on if we should, what pins would help us accomplish what we need, and/or if a cable already exists that could accomplish our goals.

Summary: Product key for software installation
Description: Dear Sir or Madam, we are PhD students from Munich working in the lab that uses your translation stage ABL 1500 for the past 10 years. It should relate to the to the Aerotech system order 163041. We use it basically 24/7/365 and it still serves us well after around 20 000 000 30 000 000 movement repetitions (down to micrometers precision). We have an issue on the software side, since the longevity of our PC doesn't match the longevity of your translation stages. PC and the software are running on Windows 7 and we would like to do one of the two options: # transfer the software to another (less buggy) Windows 7 PC, or # Get some other software that can control the stage and run on Windows 11 (preferably). Software version we have is "Ensemble 4.02.004" and our licence key = product key is: LNZXSC4V6VNT9CSDVPJNHR8H. Attached is the picture of a CD we got from you at the time of the purchase with some other (licencing, model?) numbers. When we tried to download software from your website, it told us that our licence is "out of maintenance". When we tried to install the software from CD, we couldn't finish the installation because we were asked to input 16 characters licence key / password. Using the licence key from above doesn't work, since it is 24 characters long. Could you help us out in how to use this software with the provided CD on any other windows 7 PC? What would be our options to upgrade software to a version that can run on Windows 11?

Summary: Regarding process to setup new tools
Description: I need your review about how we setup a new Aerotech Motion System. We get Main Stage USB with MCD files Grating Stage USB with MCD files Our Motion system consists of 2 additional controllers and associated stages. See attached image. Here is how I setup a new system # Ensure the daisychain is correct (as per the attached image. iXR3 will become our primary) # Power up the controllers # Install Automation1, MDK (no iSMC needed for iXR3) # Connect iXR3 using USB and setup its ip address as per our design document # Update Software on the controllers using the option available in Automation1 # Load previous tool’s MCD File # Go through Machine Setup and make sure it finds all controllers and maps with the stages correctly # Open the shipped MCD file to Compare and copy over ALL parameters to the configs # Perform Encoder Tuning and EasyTune for each of the stages. (We decouple STA and STB and tune them independently and then couple them back where STB is a follower to STA) # Verify all stages motion range and directions Here is my reasoning for using previous tools MCD file instead of starting from scratch with the shipped MCD file # Shipped MCD file is not complete. Main Stage and Grating come separate. Then 2 more stages have to be added manually. # The stages are not happy with the shipped MCD file and I have to anyways perform Encoder Tuning and EasyTune later # I had much more success by using previous tools MCD file. The is something about the shipped USB MCD file that the stages are never happy. Concerns # Are we missing out on copying any critical parameters from the shipped MCD file? # Is it OK the way I am doing? Anything that I should improve which will help save time and resole your concerns?

Description: We are using 3 linear stages for many years with a LabVIEW software developed internally using the vi we purchased from Aerotech more than 10 years ago. The current OS is Windows 7 but we have to upgrade to Windows 11. However, it looks like the Soloist software suite v4.02.003 can't be installed on Win11, preventing us to migrate. The LabVIEW installer is working fine even if the installer has been created many years ago under LabVIEW 7 or 8. What would be the recommended path in order to be able to use Win11 ? Is it possible to simply upgrade the current Soloist software to a Win11 compatible version? If you confirm this is actually an option, do you foresee any compatibility issue with the current LabVIEW that we have? Normally, drivers are backward compatible but I'm not sure. Here are the System Serial Numbers that we have: 142713A11 163157A11 163157A21 And the Software Serial Number available on the CD 163157A31 Thanks for you help Louis-Pierre Lalonde

Summary: PSO Window setup assistance / example code
Description: I am having some difficulty getting the PSOWindow functionality working as intended. Would you have some basic example code available I could review to find where I’m going wrong? Or even better if you can look at what I’m doing below and point me in the right direction? For reference: I’m running Automation1 v2.8.0 on an XR3 with Absolute encoders. I’ve pulled this out of my software and am working in the Automation1 Studio with a very distilled version just to get basic functionality working. I expect I’m missing something simple here. Axis configuration order is: Z, Y, X, Platen. The electrical connection is the Z axis with is axis 0 The motion axis I am listening to is X or axis 2 I am testing axis position(Position Feedback) 2”(5088000) to 4”(1016000) In AeroScript without my code running I can manually switch the output using: PsoOutputConfigureOutput(Z,PsoOutputPin.XR3PsoOutput1) PsoOutputOn(Z) Dwell(5) PsoOutputOff(Z) // this all functions as expected and verifies electrical connection and output configuration. ========================================= Attempting to configure the PSOWindow: PsoOutputConfigureOutput(Z,PsoOutputPin.XR3PsoOutput1) PsoWindowConfigureInput(X,0PsoWindowInput.XR3PrimaryFeedbackAxis3,0) PsoWindowConfigureFixedRange(X,PsoWindowInput.XR3PrimaryFeedbackAxis1,1016000,508000) PsoWindowConfigureEvents(X,PsoWindowEventMode.Both) PsoWindowOutputOn(X,0) … Do motion stuff … PsoReset(Z) // also resetting others but don’t expect this is necessary. ========================================== In my program the positions will be changing, it looks like the new implementation long longer allows the “UNITS” option for axis position and is requesting an integer only. I’m expecting this is encoder counts/Position Feedback from the Status utility is where I’m gathering the values shown above. Am I misreading this and there is a way to configure the PSOWindow via axis positions? The Window will only ever be configured for the Xaxis and only ever drive the Zaxis output. I will also be using the Pulse window option but I hope I can get this running once I figure out where I went wrong above. I have tried several iterations of the above sample code and have not been able to get much further than seeing PSO Status of X change. I have been monitoring Status Utility>Drive Info>PSO. is there a better place I should be looking for these states/status? I will continue working on this however, I’ve read through all the available documentation I can find for this. At this point I am just trying variations of what I have listed above. Thanks, Joe

Summary: ABRX-100 Initial Setup
Description: I have the air supply ready to go for starting an ARBX100 stage for the first time. The hardware manual doesn’t have any specific directions for initial startup for connecting the air supply. Right now the shipping bracket holding the rotating stage to the bottom platform is still affixed. I was wondering if you had stepby-step instructions for the safest way to proceed without damaging the stage. Should I first connect the air supply to the stage (at recommended pressure/flow), remove the shipping bracket, mount the stage load, then proceed with connecting the stage to the computer? Also, I just wanted to clarify the flow settings required for the stage. In the hardware manual 1.3 Basic Specifications it lists the Air Consumption of the ABRX100 as 18 SLPM. On the next page 1.4 Air Requirements it says an airflow rate of 56 SLPM is required. Does this mean I should set my flowmeter to 56 SLPM while disconnected from the stage, but observe it at 18 SLPM during stage operation? We were receiving help from David Steinberg, but he is out of office.

Summary: Cannot get Machine Setup to work - when attempting update I get error (2)
Description: Sales order 623656 I have loaded Automation 1 on the computer (now loaded with Windows 11) and am trying to configure it to connect correctly. When I open the Machine Setup I get a message “Controller is stopped” with no options to proceed. I found on an article that this can occur if the software needs to be updated. When I go to the Controller to update, I get the following error when I click “Update Software”: “There was a problem communicating with the controller: The controller could not start because of an internal realtime initialization error (2).” If I go into the CLI and attempt to initialize the controller, I get the same error. In either the CLI or the console, I can click on discover and see that the controller is detected (actually in 3 ways the loopback address, the 169 autoconfig address, and the computer’s LAN IP address). Can you please help me figure out what I am missing so that I can move to the next steps? Thank you.

Summary: Hexapod wiring question
Description: Hello, I’m working on a project for the University of Arizona, and I recently inherited a hex300 hexapod that we purchased from you before the pandemic (Serial # 611627), which has not been used since. I was tasked with figuring out how to control it , and in my attempt to do so I used some straight through DB25 gender changers to connect the motors to the A3200. This obviously didn’t work (position feedback fault), and I have since discovered that these connections are meant to be mirrored as called out in some of the drawings I later managed to dig up. Since then, I had some cables made which mirror the DB25 pins horizontally (pin 1 to 13, pin 2 to 12 etc). Now I am able to enable two of the axes, but the other four still report position feedback faults. Given that I was never able to enable the motors when I was using the regular gender changers, can I safely assume that I did NOT damage any electronics? And are there any other steps I need to take to diagnose the problem, which aren’t covered in the help docs?

Description: Support, We are controlling 12 Teknic Motors with 4x Automation SI4 modules. I have everything working great from a motion control standpoint (step, direction, and enabling) but I’m stuck on piping in the Amplifier faults. I have it wired electrically such that Aerotech sees the bit tripping, but due to the minimal configuration options I have on the Teknic motors, the only output I can use is the “Servo On” configuration which requires the Enable Bit to be set high from Aerotech. As you can imagine, Aerotech will see this as a Faulted Axis/Amplifier and will not allow us to Enable it leaving us stuck in the faulted state. I’m pretty sure the odds are not in my favor, but is there a way to setup the Parameter files such that the enable will ignore the faulted state for a fixed time, so the Teknic motor has a chance to drive the Servo On bit high? !image003.png\ thumbnail!

Summary: troubleshooting Configure Homing step
Description: I am wondering if I could ask for some assistance in troubleshooting the homing setup for our motor. I am new to this process, so apologies in advance that any issues might just reflect my lack of experience. I’m also happy to talk over the phone/Zoom if that works better. Background: Our motor was acquired several years ago. We very recently upgraded to the new controller and software. I am attaching the MCD file corresponding to my most recent settings in Automation1, in addition to other files that might be helpful. I am working through the checklist items. On the Homing Configuration step, I am accepting all the defaults (see the attached homing_screenshots.docx). This includes the “To Marker Only” Home Type. When I click “Start” under “Test the home cycle and apply changes”, the motor starts to move, but is ultimately aborted by a PositionErrorFault. Currently, the PositionErrorThreshold is set at 36 degrees, but I continue to see the fault with PositionErrorThreshold settings as high as 89 degrees. I am not sure if I should try setting the PositionErrorThreshold setting even higher. There are physical limits in place that prevent the movement from going beyond about an 89 degree range. I have attached pictures that illustrate this (apologies that I cannot describe better – I am just now getting acquainted with this equipment. Also apologies that it is sort of grimy). The limited range is consistent with our expected application of the motor. I am also attaching videos that show what does happen when I try to run the home cycle test, with Home Start Direction set to either CCW or CW. Motion stops because the fault occurs. I am wondering if the solution is to set the PositionErrorThreshold setting higher, and if so, if that would require temporarily removing the physical barriers, for this purpose of homing configuration? Or perhaps I should try something different? Thanks in advance, and please let me know if there are any issues with the attachments (e.g., if you need different photo/video formats).

Both activations have been used, one in August and the other in October. I am wondering if you are confusing a previous Automation1iSMC license or Automation1MDK license with the one you need now. Those two types of licenses are not interchangeable, and they each have their own keys and seats. The Automation1iSMC license purchased on SO 641927 had one seat that was activated this month. An Automation1MDK license on the same sales order also had one seat, but it has not been activated yet. Each has its own key.

I’m reaching out to you today with a question regarding the license key. I managed to install and launch Automation1 one a laptop a few months ago but when I tried to do it again on a different laptop, it gave me trouble when activating it, although the license key worked for the download of the install files. Have you encountered this issue before? Is there a limit to the number of computers that software can be activated on? Thank you very much!

Customer: NISHIYAMA Corporation of America
Status: Resolved
Summary: Software configuration confirmation from installation media
Description: The software configuration of the A3200 cannot be identified as before. Previously, it could be confirmed in the \\\\Software Key\\\\Information.xml file on the installation media, as shown in attached screenshot1. On this controller, it is displayed as shown in attached screenshot2, and since there is no note in “Options”, it cannot be confirmed. It can only be confirmed for the first time on the following screen during the A3200 installation process on the installation media. (attached screenshot3) In addition, the installation media case previously had a Software Key and SN sticker. (as in attached screenshot4) However, this controller only has a label with SN only. (as in attached screenshot5) Questions/requests 1. Were these changes made due to a specification change? →If it is a specification change, could you revert back to the original spec? 2. Is it possible to replace the A3200 media case with previous label spec or the label?

Summary: Open loop output current setup
Description: This is ab XR3 based system with XSL31040 Amplifiers. For calibration purposes (there is a necessity to verify amplifier’s current readback accuracy), amplifier output gets connected to 10 Ohm resistor. What configuration and commands needs to be applied to the drive in order to send 100 - 500 mA current through this resistor. Our legacy NPAQ based system did it utilizing MSET command in aerobasic script. Application of the same parameters and commands to the new system does not work. No output power registered.
